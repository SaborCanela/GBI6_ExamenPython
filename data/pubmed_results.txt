AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1895) is the anthropophilic
      and day-biter mosquito, residing in peridomestic habitats and is responsible for 
      vector-borne diseases i.e., chikungunya and dengue. The knowledge of mosquito
      life demographics is very important to provide a foundation for a successful
      vector control program. In the present study, a comparative adult life table,
      survival, and fecundity parameters were evaluated on desert (Jodhpur, Rajasthan) 
      and coastal (Kolkata, West Bengal) strains of Aedes albopictus (Diptera:
      Culicidae) from India under the standard laboratory conditions. The results
      showed significant differences between these strains for the life expectancy of
      males, fecundity (total eggs/cohort and eggs/female life span), oviposition days,
      intrinsic rate of increase (rm), finite rate of increase (lambda), and doubling
      time (DT). Female mosquitoes lived longer than the males in both strains.
      Significant differences were observed in the net reproductive rate (R0) between
      Kolkata and Jodhpur strains. The coastal (Kolkata) strain showed a longer male
      life expectancy (5.6 days) than the desert strain (4.0 days). However, the
      fecundity (eggs/female lifespan) was higher in Kolkata (360.2) than the Jodhpur
      strain (229.7). The Kolkata strain showed higher R0, rm, lambda, and the lower T,
      DT than the Jodhpur strain. Conclusively, the results indicate that the coastal
      strain of Ae. albopictus is more r-strategist than the desert strain. This study 
      may help in the precise prediction of Ae. albopictus population dynamics
      surviving in these geographical areas for vector management.

TI  - Seroepidemiological study of Japanese encephalitis virus in Chiang Mai: Immunity 
      and susceptibility 28 years after introduction of a vaccination programme.
PG  - e0010674
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010674 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thailand has introduced a nationwide vaccination against Japanese
      encephalitis virus (JEV) into National Immunization Programme since the 1990's.
      To improve the understanding of immunity and susceptibility of the population
      after 28 years of a vaccination programme, we conducted a JEV seroepidemiological
      study in a JEV-endemic area of Thailand. METHODS: An age-stratified,
      population-based, seroepidemiological study was conducted in Chiang Mai,
      Thailand-a northern Thai province where is an endemic area of Japanese
      encephalitis. Nine districts were chosen based on administrative definition:
      rural (n = 3); urban (n = 3); and peri-urban (n = 3). Within each district,
      eligible participants were randomly selected from 3 age groups: adolescents
      (10-20 years); adults (21-50 years); and older adults/elderly (>/=51 years) by
      computer randomization. Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT50 and PRNT90)
      were performed to measure neutralizing antibodies to JEV. To account for the
      cross-reactivity of JEV and other flaviviruses, JEV seroprotection was defined
      according to age, previous history of JEV vaccination, and PRNT50/PRNT90 levels
      of study participants. RESULTS: Overall, 279 adolescents, 297 adults, and 297
      older adults/elderly were enrolled from nine districts. Age-stratified,
      protocol-defined, cluster-adjusted JEV seroprotection rates were 61% (95% CI:
      48-73%), 43% (95% CI: 31-57%), and 52% (95% CI: 37-67%) for adolescents, adults, 
      and older adults/elderly, respectively. Living in peri-urban districts, having a 
      history of prior dengue virus infection, and previously receiving mouse
      brain-derived JEV vaccine were significantly associated with seroprotection to
      JEV in adolescents. Older age and male sex were associated with seroprotection
      for adults; and only male sex was the associated factor for older adults/elderly 
      (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of population living in a JEV-endemic 
      area demonstrated seroprotection to JEV. Ongoing nationwide surveillance on JEV
      seropepidemiology is an important strategy to understand the evolving
      population-level immunity to JEV, and to help formulating the appropriate
      recommendations on JE immunization.

TI  - CHARACTERIZATION OF INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE IN AEDES AEGYPTI FROM THE ZOOLOGICAL
      GARDEN OF HAVANA, CUBA.
LID - 10.2987/22-7068 [doi]
AB  - Chemical control of Aedes aegypti continues to be an indispensable alternative to
      preventing dengue, Zika, and chikungunya outbreaks. The Havana Zoological Garden 
      requires constant vigilance because its special characteristics help in the
      spread of the causal agents of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, which put the 
      health of visitors at risk. The goals of this study were to determine the level
      of susceptibility and insecticide resistance mechanisms in the Ae. aegypti
      population. Temephos susceptibility in larvae was evaluated with bioassays using 
      the World Health Organization's methodology, and susceptibility of adult
      mosquitoes was determined by the impregnated bottle bioassay, recommended by the 
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Resistance mechanisms were determined
      with biochemical assays. Mosquito larvae from the Havana Zoo were found resistant
      to temephos, which was associated with the activity of the enzymes alpha- and
      beta-esterases and mixed function oxidases but not glutathione-S-transferase.
      Adult mosquitoes were susceptible to pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin,
      deltamethrin, and cypermethrin), organophosphate (chlorpyrifos), and carbamate
      (bendiocarb). Temephos resistance detected in the mosquito population from the
      Havana Zoo is an alert for the Vector Control Program, which must take measures
      to manage their resistance, relying on the surveillance carried out by Cuba's
      medical entomology laboratories.

AB  - Optimized methods for the detection of flavivirus infections in hyperendemic
      areas are still needed, especially for working with patient serum as a starting
      material. The focus-forming assay (FFA) reveals critical aspects of virus-host
      interactions, as it is a quantitative assay to determine viral loads. Automated
      image analysis provides evaluations of relative amounts of intracellular viral
      protein at the single-cell level. Here, we developed an optimized FFA for the
      detection of infectious Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) viral particles
      in cell cultures and clinical serum samples, respectively. Vero-76 cells were
      infected with DENV-2 (16681) or ZIKV (PRVA BC59). Using a panel of anti-DENV and 
      anti-ZIKV NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the primary mAbs,
      concentration, and the optimal time of infection were determined. To determine
      whether intracellular accumulation of NS1 improved the efficiency of the FFA,
      brefeldin A was added to the cultures. Focus formation was identified by
      conventional optical microscopy combined with CellProfiler automated image
      analysis software. The FFA was used with spike assays for ZIKV and clinical
      specimens from natural infection by DENV-1 and DENV-2. mAb 7744-644 for ZIKV and 
      mAb 724-323 for DENV used at a concentration of 1 mug/ml and a time of 24 hours
      postinfection produced the best detection of foci when combining conventional
      counting and automated digital analysis. Brefeldin A did not improve the
      assessment of FFUs or their digitally assessed intensity at single-cell level.
      The FFA showed 95% ZIKV recovery and achieved the detection of circulating DENV-1
      and DENV-2 in the plasma of acutely ill patients. The combination of the two
      techniques optimized the FFA, allowing the study of DENV and ZIKV in culture
      supernatants and clinical specimens from natural infection in hyperendemic areas.

AB  - The infectious disease dengue hemorrhagic fever remains an unresolved global
      problem, with climatic conditions and the location of areas located at the
      equator more often infected with dengue fever. Various modeling approaches have
      been employed for the development of a dengue risk map. The geographic
      information system approach was used as an instrument in applying mathematical
      algorithms to process field vector data into a preventive objective which is
      studied, then the application of remote sensing provides spatial-temporal data
      related to land use/land cover data sources as other variable categories. Map of 
      hotspots for dengue fever cases is used to identify the risk of dengue fever
      areas by applying various complex methodologies, analysis, and visualization of
      advanced data are needed for its application in public health. In the last 10
      years, the increase in the publication of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Southeast
      Asia in reputable international journals has increased significantly.

AB  - Introduction: Co-infection with different agents such as bacterial, viral, and
      Rickettsia is being increasingly recognized due to greater availability and
      utilization of the diagnostic tests among malaria patients. Methods: Consecutive 
      admitted malarial cases were included and were subjected to test for general
      investigations, bacteria, typhoid, dengue, chikungunya, and rest for specific
      diagnosis. All patients were followed up till discharge or death and appropriate 
      statistical tests were performed. Results: A total of 152 malaria patients were
      recruited and 27 (18.8%) had concurrent infections. It included 40.7% dengue
      only, 18.7% pneumonia, 11.1% urinary tract infection (UTI), 7.4% enteric fever,
      3.7% leptospirosis, chikungunya, and tuberculous meningitis each, and 3.7% each
      of dengue with pneumonia and UTI. The organisms isolated were Streptococcus
      pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The mean duration of fever was 6.33 +/- 3.63 days
      with a range of 3-20 days. Blood culture grew in 2 cases S. typhi and K.
      pneumonia,e. Dengue co-infections had significantly higher clinical and
      laboratory features of dengue and complications such as bleeding, jaundice, and
      cholecystitis, whereas rest concurrent infections had a significantly higher
      proportion of nausea and vomiting, convulsion, altered sensorium, productive
      cough, urinary symptoms, shock, acute kidney injury, anemia, and mean neutrophil 
      count. There was significantly higher mortality among malaria-dengue concurrent
      infection group with 2 (15.4%) than malaria mono-infection group 3 (2.4%).
      Conclusion: Co-infections with malaria are not uncommon, especially dengue fever 
      and other bacterial infections. The dominant clinical picture is of the
      superimposed infection. Decision should be clinically guided adjunct with
      specific diagnostic tests, and timely treatment has favorable outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasma leakage is a major pathogenic manifestation of severe dengue
      and is a precursor of life-threatening complications associated with dengue.
      Accumulating evidence indicates the role of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) in
      mediating vascular permeability and plasma leakage following induction by the
      dengue virus. This study aims to investigate the utility of MMP-2, MMP-3, and
      MMP-9 in predicting the severity of dengue infection and further explore the
      relationship of these markers with the pathogenic factors associated with plasma 
      leakage. METHODS: The dengue-positive subjects were classified into mild and
      severe dengue groups based on the manifestation of warning signs. The samples in 
      each group and healthy controls were quantified for basic laboratory
      characteristics. The levels of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and Macrophage migration
      inhibitory factor (MIF) were estimated in all serum samples using a multiplex
      bead-based assay. RESULTS: MMP-2 and MMP-9 were markedly elevated in severe
      dengue patients compared to mild dengue patients and healthy controls. No
      alteration in the circulating levels of MMP-3 was observed between the study
      groups. ROC curve analysis indicated that MMP-2 and MMP-9 exhibited good
      potential for predicting severe dengue. Notably, an increase in MMP-9 was
      associated with increased MIF and Hematocrit levels in severe dengue patients.
      CONCLUSION: MMP-2 and MMP-9 could serve as prognostic biomarkers for severe
      dengue. These findings also identify the association of MMP-9 with markers of
      plasma leakage, thereby encouraging further studies to explore the therapeutic
      potential of targeting MMP-9 in managing plasma leakage in severe dengue.

      The European paradox.

AB  - The global distribution of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is the subject
      of considerable attention because of its pivotal role as a biological vector of
      several high profile disease pathogens including dengue, chikungunya, yellow
      fever, and Zika viruses. There is also a lot of interest in the projected future 
      species' distribution. However, less effort has been focused on its historical
      distribution, which has changed substantially over the past 100years, especially 
      in southern Europe where it was once widespread, but largely disappeared by the
      middle of the 20th century. The present work utilises all available historical
      records of the distribution of Ae. aegypti in southern Europe, the Near East
      within the Mediterranean Basin and North Africa from the late 19th century until 
      the 1960's to construct a spatial distribution model using matching historical
      climatic and demographic data. The resulting model was then implemented using
      current climate and demographic data to assess the potential distribution of the 
      vector in the present. The models were rerun with several different assumptions
      about the thresholds that determine habitat suitability for Ae. aegypti. The
      historical model matches the historical distributions well. When it is run with
      current climate values, the predicted present day distribution is somewhat
      broader than it used to be particularly in north-west France, North Africa and
      Turkey. Though it is beginning to reappear in the eastern Caucasus, this
      'potential' distribution clearly does not match the actual distribution of the
      species, which suggests some other factors are responsible for its absence.
      Future distributions based on the historical model also do not match future
      distributions derived from models based only on present day vector distributions,
      which predict little or no presence in the Mediterranean Region. At the same
      time, the vector is widespread in the USA which is predicted to consolidate its
      range there in future. This contradiction and the implication for possible
      re-invasion of Europe are discussed.

TI  - Beyond arboviruses: A multicenter study to evaluate differential diagnosis of
      rash diseases and acute febrile illness cases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
PG  - e0271758
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271758 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A wide variety of viruses can cause rash diseases (RDs) or acute
      febrile illness (AFIs) in children, adolescents and adults; however,
      approximately 19% of RD cases and 40% of AFI cases remain without a defined
      etiology. Parvovirus B19 (B19V) and herpesvirus infection can also cause RD
      and/or AFI, and in some risk groups, these infections can become persistent (or
      latent) and may require hospital treatment. Since these infections do not have
      mandatory reporting, they can be hidden by other diseases, such as those caused
      by arboviruses (e.g., dengue virus). In this context, the aim of this study was
      to pursue the differential laboratory diagnoses of B19V and herpesvirus
      infections in patients with RD and AFI, without a defined etiology, seen in
      hospitals and/or reference centers for infectious diseases in Rio de Janeiro.
      METHODS: A total of 114 participants were enrolled in the study, including 54
      children and 60 adults. B19V infection was assessed by real-time PCR (qPCR) and
      ELISA (anti-B19V IgM and IgG). EBV was assessed through qPCR, and
      betaherpesviruses (HCMV, HHV-6 and HHV-7) were assessed through multiplex qPCR.
      Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained from the medical record data of 
      these participants. RESULTS: The median age of children with RD was 2 years
      (interquartile range (IQR): 5), and 55.6% were male. Among adults with AFI, the
      median age was 38 years (IQR: 21), and 56.7% were female. Regarding RD patients, 
      viral prevalence (and load) were 5.5%(104IU/mL), 3.4%(104IU/mL), 5.5%(104IU/mL)
      and 11.1%(105IU/mL) for B19V, EBV, HCMV and HHV-6 infection, respectively, and in
      AFI patients they were 6.6%(105IU/mL), 1.6%(103IU/mL), 3.3%(104IU/mL) for B19V,
      HCMV and HHV-6, respectively. HHV-7 was not detected in RD or AFI patients.
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest the importance of including B19V and
      herpesviruses in the differential laboratory diagnoses for patients with RD and
      AFI, not only for epidemiological purposes but also for the proper management of 
      the patient.

      experience between the scientific, municipal and citizen ambits].
PG  - 505-512
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In Argentina, during the last decade a southward expansion of the
      mosquito Aedes aegypti has been observed, accompanied by an expansion in the
      dengue transmission. The objective of this study was to assess the establishment 
      of the dengue mosquito vector in a locality next to its distribution limits by a 
      collaborative work among scientific, municipal and citizen ambits. METHODS: A
      vector surveillance system through ovitraps was implemented, and it was
      complemented by pictures and mosquitoes captured by citizens, and by the active
      search of breeding sites in different urban spaces of Tandil City, Argentina.
      RESULTS: The establishment of Aedes aegypti population in the city was
      demonstrated, both by ovitraps and citizen science contributions. This
      information made it possible to begin to make the problem visible among municipal
      authorities and citizens. DISCUSSION: Dengue is an invisible disease in
      localities in which the mosquito vector has been spreading during the last
      decade. The information produced by the entomological surveillance is the
      necessary basis to addresssocial communication to produce behavioral changes in
      the responsible authorities as well as in the families.

LID - 10.1007/s11883-022-01057-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Since the discovery of PCSK9 in 2003, this proprotein
      convertase was shown to target specific receptors for degradation in
      endosomes/lysosomes, including LDLR and other family members and hence to enhance
      the levels of circulating LDL-cholesterol (LDLc). Accordingly, inhibitors of
      PCSK9, including monoclonal antibodies blocking its circulating activity and
      siRNA silencers of its hepatic expression, are now used in clinics worldwide to
      treat hypercholesterolemia patients effectively and safely in combination with
      statins and/or ezetimibe. These powerful treatments reduce the incidence of
      atherosclerosis by at least 20%. Since 2008, novel targets of PCSK9 began to be
      defined, thereby expanding its roles beyond LDLc regulation into the realm of
      inflammation, pathogen infections and cellular proliferation in various cancers
      and associated metastases. RECENT FINDINGS: Some pathogens such as dengue virus
      exploit the ability of PCSK9 to target the LDLR for degradation to enhance their 
      ability to infect cells. Aside from increasing the degradation of the LDLR and
      its family members VLDLR, ApoER2 and LRP1, circulating PCSK9 also reduces the
      levels of other receptors such as CD36 (implicated in fatty acid uptake),
      oxidized LDLR receptor (that clears oxidized LDLc) as well as major
      histocompatibility class-I (MHC-I) receptors (implicated in the immune response
      to antigens). Thus, these novel targets provided links between PCSK9 and
      inflammation/atherosclerosis, viral infections and cancer/metastasis. The
      functional activities of PCSK9, accelerated the development of novel therapies to
      inhibit PCSK9 functions, including small molecular inhibitors, long-term
      vaccines, and possibly CRISPR-based silencing of hepatic expression of PCSK9. The
      future of inhibitors/silencers of PCSK9 function or expression looks bright, as
      these are expected to provide a modern armamentarium to treat various pathologies
      beyond hypercholesterolemia and its effects on atherosclerosis.

TI  - Overview of dengue outbreaks in the southwestern Indian Ocean and analysis of
      factors involved in the shift toward endemicity in Reunion Island: A systematic
      review.
PG  - e0010547
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010547 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the world's most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease. It
      is endemic in many tropical and subtropical countries and represents a
      significant global health burden. The first reports of dengue virus (DENV)
      circulation in the South West Indian Ocean (SWIO) islands date back to the early 
      1940s; however, an increase in DENV circulation has been reported in the SWIO in 
      recent years. The aim of this review is to trace the history of DENV in the SWIO 
      islands using available records from the Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte,
      Seychelles, and Reunion. We focus in particular on the most extensive data from
      Reunion Island, highlighting factors that may explain the observed increasing
      incidence, and the potential shift from one-off outbreaks to endemic dengue
      transmission. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, the literature review
      focused queried different databases using the keywords "dengue" or "Aedes
      albopictus" combined with each of the following SWIO islands the Comoros,
      Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Seychelles, and Reunion. We also compiled case
      report data for dengue in Mayotte and Reunion in collaboration with the regional 
      public health agencies in these French territories. References and data were
      discarded when original sources were not identified. We examined reports of
      climatic, anthropogenic, and mosquito-related factors that may influence the
      maintenance of dengue transmission independently of case importation linked to
      travel. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: The first report of dengue circulation in the
      SWIO was documented in 1943 in the Comoros. Then not until an outbreak in 1976 to
      1977 that affected approximately 80% of the population of the Seychelles. DENV
      was also reported in 1977 to 1978 in Reunion with an estimate of nearly 30% of
      the population infected. In the following 40-year period, DENV circulation was
      qualified as interepidemic with sporadic cases. However, in recent years, the
      region has experienced uninterrupted DENV transmission at elevated incidence.
      Since 2017, Reunion witnessed the cocirculation of 3 serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2
      and DENV-3) and an increased number of cases with severe forms and deaths.
      Reinforced molecular and serological identification of DENV serotypes and
      genotypes circulating in the SWIO as well as vector control strategies is
      necessary to protect exposed human populations and limit the spread of dengue.

TI  - DEAD-Box Helicase DDX3X as a Host Target against Emerging Viruses: New Insights
      for Medicinal Chemical Approaches.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c00755 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, globalization, global warming, and population aging have
      contributed to the spread of emerging viruses, such as coronaviruses (COVs), West
      Nile (WNV), Dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIKV). The number of reported infections is 
      increasing, and considering the high viral mutation rate, it is conceivable that 
      it will increase significantly in the coming years. The risk caused by viruses is
      now more evident due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the need to find
      new broad-spectrum antiviral agents able to tackle the present pandemic and
      future epidemics. DDX3X helicase is a host factor required for viral replication.
      Selective inhibitors have been identified and developed into broad-spectrum
      antivirals active against emerging pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 and most
      importantly against drug-resistant strains. This perspective describes the
      inhibitors identified in the last years, highlighting their therapeutic potential
      as innovative broad-spectrum antivirals.

TI  - Larval Competition Between Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti (Diptera:
      Culicidae) in Argentina: Coexistence and Implications in the Distribution of the 
      Asian Tiger Mosquito.
LID - tjac102 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjac102 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) are worldwide vectors of
      dengue and yellow fever viruses. These species coexist in many countries and the 
      biotic interactions between them can influence their abundances and
      distributions. In Argentina, Ae. aegypti is widely distributed in the north and
      center regions of the country, with temperate and subtropical climate, while both
      are sympatric only in the northeastern area of the subtropical region.
      Interspecific and intraspecific larval competition for food was evaluated to
      assess if their interaction influences on patterns of abundance and distribution.
      Finite rates of increase and survivorship for each species were estimated and the
      effects of mosquito density ratio and detritus availability were determined. The 
      Lambda (lambda ) index of population performance of both showed there is no
      competitive exclusion pattern. However, survival of Ae. albopictus was negatively
      affected by the presence of Ae. aegypti. These results suggest one possible
      explanation for the codominance pattern of both species display in rural regions 
      of the southernmost distribution of Ae. albopictus in South America. They also
      show Ae. aegypti as a potential biotic barrier for the expansion of Ae.
      albopictus as was reported in regions of the United States.

TI  - Identification of Potential Insect Growth Inhibitor against Aedes aegypti: A
      Bioinformatics Approach.
LID - 8218 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158218 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector that transmits viral diseases such as dengue,
      hemorrhagic dengue, urban yellow fever, zika, and chikungunya. Worldwide, many
      cases of dengue have been reported in recent years, showing significant growth.
      The best way to manage diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti is to control the
      vector with insecticides, which have already been shown to be toxic to humans;
      moreover, insects have developed resistance. Thus, the development of new
      insecticides is considered an emergency. One way to achieve this goal is to apply
      computational methods based on ligands and target information. In this study,
      sixteen compounds with acceptable insecticidal activities, with 100% larvicidal
      activity at low concentrations (2.0 to 0.001 mg.L(-1)), were selected from the
      literature. These compounds were used to build up and validate pharmacophore
      models. Pharmacophore model 6 (AUC = 0.78; BEDROC = 0.6) was used to filter 4793 
      compounds from the subset of lead-like compounds from the ZINC database; 4142
      compounds (dG &lt; 0 kcal/mol) were then aligned to the active site of the
      juvenile hormone receptor Aedes aegypti (PDB: 5V13), 2240 compounds (LE &lt;
      -0.40 kcal/mol) were prioritized for molecular docking from the construction of a
      chitin deacetylase model of Aedes aegypti by the homology modeling of the Bombyx 
      mori species (PDB: 5ZNT), which aligned 1959 compounds (dG &lt; 0 kcal/mol), and 
      20 compounds (LE &lt; -0.4 kcal/mol) were predicted for pharmacokinetic and
      toxicological prediction in silico (Preadmet, SwissADMET, and eMolTox programs). 
      Finally, the theoretical routes of compounds M01, M02, M03, M04, and M05 were
      proposed. Compounds M01-M05 were selected, showing significant differences in
      pharmacokinetic and toxicological parameters in relation to positive controls and
      interaction with catalytic residues among key protein sites reported in the
      literature. For this reason, the molecules investigated here are dual inhibitors 
      of the enzymes chitin synthase and juvenile hormonal protein from insects and
      humans, characterizing them as potential insecticides against the Aedes aegypti
      mosquito.

TI  - The Seroprevalence and Hidden Burden of Chikungunya Endemicity and Malaria Mono- 
      and Coinfection in Nigeria.
LID - 8896 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158896 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne infections are of global health concern because of
      their rapid spread and upsurge, which creates a risk for coinfections.
      Chikungunya, an arbovirus disease transmitted by Aedes aegypti or
      A.&amp;nbsp;albopictus, and malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted by Anopheles
      gambiae, are prevalent in Nigeria and neighbouring countries, but their burden
      and possible coinfections are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated
      the seroprevalence, hidden burden and endemicity of chikungunya and malaria in
      three regions in Nigeria. METHODS: A cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted on
      871 participants in three regions of Nigeria. The samples were collected from
      outpatients employing simple random sampling. All serum sample analyses were
      performed using CHIKV virus-like particle recomLine Tropical Fever for the
      presence of arboviral antibody serological marker IgG immunoblot for chikungunya 
      and malaria RDT (Rapid Diagnostic Test) for malaria parasites. RESULTS: The
      seroprevalences of chikungunya and malaria mono-infection were 64.9% and 27.7%,
      respectively, while the coinfection seroprevalence was 71.9%. The central (69.5%)
      and northern (67.0%) regions showed more significant seroprevalences than the
      southern region (48.0%). The seroprevalence and the hidden burden of chikungunya 
      and malaria infections varied across the three geographical regions. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study highlighted an unexpectedly high seroprevalence and hidden endemicity 
      of chikungunya and a less surprising high malaria endemicity in three regions of 
      Nigeria.

TI  - Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya viral circulation and hospitalization rates in
      Brazil from 2014 to 2019: An ecological study.
PG  - e0010602
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010602 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In addition to their direct pathogenic effects, arthropod-borne
      (arboviruses) have been hypothesized to indirectly contribute to hospitalizations
      and death through decompensation of pre-existing comorbidities. Using nationwide 
      data routinely collected from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2019 in Brazil, we
      investigated whether local increases in arbovirus notifications were associated
      with excess hospitalization. METHODS: We estimated the relative risks for the
      association between municipality- and state-level increases in arboviral case
      notifications and age-standardized hospitalization rates (i.e., classified as
      direct or indirect based on ICD-10 codes) using Bayesian multilevel models with
      random effects accounting for temporal and geographic correlations. For
      municipality-level analyses, we excluded municipalities with <200 notifications
      of a given arbovirus and further adjusted the models for the local Gini Index,
      Human Development Index, and Family Healthcare Strategy (Estrategia de Saude da
      Familia) coverage. Models for dengue, Zika, and chikungunya were performed
      separately. RESULTS: From 2014 to 2019, Brazil registered 7,566,330 confirmed
      dengue cases, 159,029 confirmed ZIKV cases, and 433,887 confirmed CHIKV cases.
      Dengue notifications have an endemic and seasonal pattern, with cases present in 
      5334 of the 5570 (95.8%) Brazilian municipalities and most (69.5%) registered
      between February and May. Chikungunya notifications followed a similar seasonal
      pattern to DENV but with a smaller incidence and were restricted to 4390 (78.8%) 
      municipalities. ZIKV was only notified in 2581 (46.3%) municipalities. Increases 
      in dengue and chikungunya notifications were associated with small increases in
      age-standardized arbovirus-related hospitalizations, but no consistent
      association was found with all-cause or other specific indirect causes of
      hospitalization. Zika was associated to increases in hospitalizations by
      neurological diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Although we found no clear association
      between increased incidence of the three arboviruses and excess risks of
      all-cause or indirect hospitalizations at the municipality- and state-levels,
      follow-up investigations at the individual-level are warranted to define any
      potential role of acute arbovirus infection in exacerbating risks of
      hospitalization from underlying conditions.

TI  - Local-scale virome depiction in Medellin, Colombia, supports significant
      differences between Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.
PG  - e0263143
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0263143 [doi]
AB  - Aedes spp. comprise the primary group of mosquitoes that transmit arboviruses
      such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses to humans, and thus these insects
      pose a significant burden on public health worldwide. Advancements in
      next-generation sequencing and metagenomics have expanded our knowledge on the
      richness of RNA viruses harbored by arthropods such as Ae. aegypti and Ae.
      albopictus. Increasing evidence suggests that vector competence can be modified
      by the microbiome (comprising both bacteriome and virome) of mosquitoes present
      in endemic zones. Using an RNA-seq-based metataxonomic approach, this study
      determined the virome structure, Wolbachia presence and mitochondrial diversity
      of field-caught Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in Medellin, Colombia, 
      a municipality with a high incidence of mosquito-transmitted arboviruses. The two
      species are sympatric, but their core viromes differed considerably in richness, 
      diversity, and abundance; although the community of viral species identified was 
      large and complex, the viromes were dominated by few virus species. BLAST
      searches of assembled contigs suggested that at least 17 virus species (16 of
      which are insect-specific viruses [ISVs]) infect the Ae. aegypti population.
      Dengue virus 3 was detected in one sample and it was the only pathogenic virus
      detected. In Ae. albopictus, up to 11 ISVs and one plant virus were detected.
      Therefore, the virome composition appears to be species-specific. The bacterial
      endosymbiont Wolbachia was identified in all Ae. albopictus samples and in some
      Ae. aegypti samples collected after 2017. The presence of Wolbachia sp. in Ae.
      aegypti was not related to significant changes in the richness, diversity, or
      abundance of this mosquito's virome, although it was related to an increase in
      the abundance of Aedes aegypti To virus 2 (Metaviridae). The mitochondrial
      diversity of these mosquitoes suggested that the Ae. aegypti population underwent
      a change that started in the second half of 2017, which coincides with the
      release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in Medellin, indicating that the
      population of wMel-infected mosquitoes released has introduced new alleles into
      the wild Ae. aegypti population of Medellin. However, additional studies are
      required on the dispersal speed and intergenerational stability of wMel in
      Medellin and nearby areas as well as on the introgression of genetic variants in 
      the native mosquito population.

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is recognized but rarely considered as a cause of
      central nervous system infection in endemic areas. A total of 244 patients with
      acute meningoencephalitis in Indonesia were retrospectively tested to identify
      whether any CHIKV infection was associated with neurological manifestations,
      especially in provinces known for CHIKV endemicity. Cerebrospinal fluid and blood
      specimens were tested using CHIKV-specific real-time reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction and IgM ELISA, alongside a panel of neurotropic
      viruses. We report four cases of suspected or confirmed CHIKV-associated
      neurological disease, including CHIKV RNA detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
      of one patient and in acute serum of another, and CHIKV IgM in CSF of three
      patients and in serum of a fourth. In conclusion, CHIKV should be considered as a
      cause of neurologic disease in endemic areas and especially during outbreaks, in 
      addition to the more common arboviral diseases such as dengue and Japanese
      encephalitis viruses.

TI  - Phenotypic Variations of Aedes aegypti Populations and Egg Abundance According to
      Environmental Parameters in Two Dengue-Endemic Ecoregions in Paraguay.
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.21-1184 [doi]
LID - tpmd211184 [pii]
AB  - Dengue in Paraguay is an endemic disease of public health importance. Several
      studies suggest that an increased density of Aedes aegypti and the presence of
      dengue cases may be associated with climatic conditions. This study aimed to
      establish the phenotypic variations of Ae. aegypti from four cities (Asuncion,
      Itaugua, Minga Guazu, and Ciudad del Este) and the potential association of
      environmental variables with the number of eggs in capture sites. Eleven
      morphometric phenotypic characters were evaluated, and environmental data were
      obtained from Earth Engine and local meteorological stations. An analysis was
      carried out using principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis, 
      and we estimated the correlation using [relative humidity, Normalized Difference 
      Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)] between
      variables and the number of eggs in each site. Differences in mean NDVI and NDWI 
      between cities and their relationship with the morphometric performance of
      individuals were also assessed. The study demonstrated morphometric variations
      between the populations of Ae. aegypti from two ecoregions, with the Litoral
      ecoregion populations presented a greater phenotypic variation than those
      observed in the Alto Parana ecoregion. Significant statistical associations were 
      registered between the number of eggs with relative humidity (r = -0.45) and the 
      NDVI at 100 meters from the capture points (r = -0.61) for Minga Guazu, and with 
      the NDWI at 100 meters (r = 0.54) for Ciudad del Este. Future studies on these
      Ae. aegypti populations, and its dispersion could contribute to improve vector
      control measures and foster future genetic studies.

TI  - Genomic Sequencing of Dengue Virus Strains Associated with Papua New Guinean
      Outbreaks in 2016 Reveals Endemic Circulation of DENV-1 and DENV-2.
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.21-1292 [doi]
LID - tpmd211292 [pii]
AB  - Over the past decade, the Pacific region has experienced many arboviral
      outbreaks, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Papua New Guinea
      (PNG) has a high burden of arboviral diseases, but there is a paucity of
      knowledge about the epidemiology and circulation of these viruses in the country.
      In this study, we report investigations into suspected arboviral outbreaks of
      febrile disease in PNG from December 2015 to June 2017. DENV-1 and DENV-2 were
      the mostly commonly detected viruses, and low circulation of DENV-3 and ZIKV was 
      also detected. DENV-4 and CHIKV were not detected during this period. Full genome
      sequencing of selected positive samples revealed that circulation was dominated
      by endemic indigenous strains belonging to DENV-1 (genotype IV) and DENV-2
      (genotype C) that have been present in the country for up to a decade. A DENV-2
      sublineage was also identified that has been associated with outbreaks of severe 
      dengue in both PNG and the Solomon Islands.

TI  - Leptospirosis among Dengue-Negative Febrile Patients in Selangor, Malaysia.
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.20-0656 [doi]
LID - tpmd200656 [pii]
AB  - In recent years, the number of leptospirosis cases, including the number of
      deaths, has exponentially increased in Malaysia. From June 2016 to February 2018,
      blood samples of 321 febrile patients with the presumptive diagnosis of
      dengue-like illness were examined for possible exposure to Leptospira. Two
      hundred fifty-five blood samples were tested as negative for dengue. Seminested
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and IgM ELISA for leptospirosis were performed.
      From the samples, an overall prevalence for leptospirosis based on PCR of 4.7%
      (12/255) was obtained. Eighteen percent (46/255) were positive for
      anti-Leptospira IgM antibodies. The genome sequences of six of 12 Leptospira
      PCR-positive samples showed > 97.0% similarity to Leptospira interrogans. One
      patient's sample consisted of Leptospira and chikungunya virus, suggesting a
      coinfection. Findings from the study suggest that leptospirosis is prevalent
      among dengue-negative febrile patients in Malaysia.

LID - tpmd211087 [pii]
AB  - Standard molecular detection of many pathogens, in particular RNA viruses,
      requires appropriate handling in the field for preserving the quality of the
      sample until processing. This could be challenging in remote tropical areas.
      Dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) are RNA
      viruses, prominent among the causes of fever in the tropics. We aimed to test the
      stability of arboviral RNA in contrived dried blood spots prepared on Whatman 903
      Protein saver cards as a means of sample collection and storage. We were able to 
      detect DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV by real-time RT-PCR up to 180 days after card
      inoculation with stable Ct values across the study period. Our study supports
      dried blood spots (DBS) on protein saver cards as a platform for stable detection
      of arboviral RNA of sufficient quality to be used in diagnostic RT-PCR assays and
      next generation sequencing.

AB  - As of January 20, 2022, > 247,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3,400 deaths were 
      reported in Puerto Rico (PR). We interviewed participants aged >/= 14 years in
      the Communities Organized to Prevent Arboviruses (COPA) study, a community-based 
      cohort in PR, about COVID-19 vaccine intention from November 12, 2020, to June
      25, 2021. We used univariate and adjusted analyses to identify participant
      characteristics associated with vaccine intention. Among 1,542 respondents, the
      median age was 37 years (interquartile range 23-45) and 914 (59%) were female.
      Most participants (83%) reported a willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The
      most common reason for vaccine hesitancy was concern about the safety or side
      effects (64%). Willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a 
      later interview date, higher household income, previous COVID-19 diagnosis among 
      household members, COVID-19 risk perception, influenza vaccine uptake, dengue
      vaccine intention, and general positive perceptions of vaccines. While parents
      with minors (< 21 years old) were less likely to report vaccine intention for
      themselves than participants without minor children, we observed similar
      characteristics associated with parents' willingness to vaccinate their children.
      Overall, COVID-19 vaccine intention was high among COPA participants. It is
      important that public health messaging in PR addresses COVID-19 vaccine safety
      and possible side effects.

AB  - It is currently not clear whether humoral immunity to Zika virus (ZIKV) elicited 
      upon natural ZIKV infection is long-lasting. In addition, cross-reactivity of
      anti-ZIKV antibodies with antigenically related dengue viruses (DENV) may have
      biological implications in nonnaive individuals who subsequently acquire a
      heterotypic infection. Cross-reactive humoral immunity between ZIKV and DENV also
      complicates the interpretation of serological tests to evaluate previous exposure
      to either virus. Here, we have measured the 2-year decay of ZIKV neutralizing
      antibodies in people living in a ZIKV/DENV endemic area in Brazil who were
      identified as having an acute infection (group 1) or past (but recent) infection 
      (group 2) with ZIKV in 2015-16. The titers of neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV
      decreased 9.1 and 2.3 times in groups 1 and 2, respectively. We also show that
      the plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT) is a reliable method to measure 
      past exposure to ZIKV in coendemic areas.

TI  - Limited Awareness of Melioidosis in High-risk Populations Despite an Increasing
      Incidence of the Disease in Far North Queensland, Australia.
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.22-0160 [doi]
LID - tpmd220160 [pii]
AB  - The incidence of melioidosis, an opportunistic infection caused by Burkholderia
      pseudomallei, has recently doubled in Far North Queensland (FNQ), Australia. This
      contrasts with the local burden of dengue, which is nearing elimination, and the 
      stable incidence of leptospirosis. This questionnaire-based study assessed the
      awareness of melioidosis among people in FNQ with risk factors for the disease,
      using awareness of leptospirosis and dengue as comparators. There were 427
      respondents; 361 (85%) reported one or more risk factors for melioidosis. Only 69
      of 361 (19%) had heard of melioidosis compared with 301 of 361 (83%) who had
      heard of dengue (P < 0.001) and 137 of 361 (38%) who had heard of leptospirosis
      (P < 0.001). In FNQ, Australia, there is an increasing local incidence of
      melioidosis, but there is limited awareness of the disease among high-risk
      individuals. Greater community awareness of melioidosis is necessary to implement
      strategies to prevent disease and expedite the presentation of patients with this
      life-threatening infection.

TI  - Wolbachia wPip Blocks Zika Virus Transovarial Transmission in Aedes albopictus.
PG  - e0263321
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02633-21 [doi]
AB  - Wolbachia is being developed as a biological tool to suppress mosquito
      populations and/or interfere with their transmitted viruses. Adult males with an 
      artificial Wolbachia infection have been released, successfully yielding
      population suppression in multiple field trials. The main characteristic of the
      artificial Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes used in the suppression program is the
      lower vector competence than that in native infected/uninfected mosquitoes in
      horizontal and vertical transmission. Our previous studies have demonstrated that
      the Aedes albopictus HC line infected with a trio of Wolbachia strains exhibited 
      almost complete blockade of dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in
      horizontal and vertical transmission. However, the extent to which Wolbachia
      inhibits virus transovarial transmission is unknown since no studies have been
      performed to determine whether Wolbachia protects ovarian cells against viral
      infection. Here, we employed ovarian cells of the Ae. albopictus GUA (a wild-type
      mosquito line superinfected with two native Wolbachia strains, wAlbA and wAlbB), 
      HC, and GT lines (tetracycline-cured, Wolbachia-uninfected mosquitoes), which
      exhibit key traits, and compared them to better understand how Wolbachia inhibits
      ZIKV transovarial transmission. Our results showed that the infection rate of
      adult GT progeny was significantly higher than that of GUA progeny during the
      first and second gonotrophic cycles. In contrast, the infection rates of adult GT
      and GUA progeny were not significantly different during the third gonotrophic
      cycle. All examined adult HC progeny from three gonotrophic cycles were negative 
      for ZIKV infection. A strong negative linear correlation existed between
      Wolbachia density and ZIKV load in the ovaries of mosquitoes. Although there is
      no obvious coexistence area in the ovaries for Wolbachia and ZIKV, host immune
      responses may play a role in Wolbachia blocking ZIKV expansion and maintenance in
      the ovaries of Ae. albopictus. These results will aid in understanding
      Wolbachia-ZIKV interactions in mosquitoes. IMPORTANCE Area-wide application of
      Wolbachia to suppress mosquito populations and their transmitted viruses has
      achieved success in multiple countries. However, the mass release of
      Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes involves a potential risk of accidentally
      releasing fertile females. In this study, we employed ovarian cells of the Ae.
      albopictus GUA, HC, and GT lines, which exhibit key traits, and compared them to 
      better understand how Wolbachia inhibits ZIKV transovarial transmission. Our
      results showed an almost complete blockade of ZIKV transmission in HC female
      mosquitoes. Wolbachia in natively infected GUA mosquitoes negative affected ZIKV,
      and this interference was shown by slightly lower loads than those in HC
      mosquitoes. Overall, our work helps show how Wolbachia blocks ZIKV expansion and 
      maintenance in the ovaries of Ae. albopictus and aids in understanding
      Wolbachia-ZIKV interactions in mosquitoes.

TI  - Strong Correlations between the Binding Antibodies against Wild-Type and

      Individuals Following Booster (Third-Dose) Vaccination.
LID - 1781 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12081781 [doi]
AB  - This study examined the neutralizing activity and receptor-binding domain (RBD)
      antibody levels against wild-type and omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants in
      individuals who received three doses of COVID-19 vaccination. The relationship
      between the anti-RBD IgG against wild-type and live virus neutralizing antibody
      titers against omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants was examined. In total, 310 sera
      samples from individuals after booster vaccination (third-dose) were tested for
      specific IgG wild-type SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the omicron BA.1 surrogate virus
      neutralization test (sVNT). The live virus neutralization assay against omicron
      BA.1 and BA.2 was performed using the foci-reduction neutralization test
      (FRNT50). The anti-RBD IgG strongly correlated with FRNT50 titers against BA.1
      and BA.2. Non-linear regression showed that anti-RBD IgG at the cut-off value
      >/=148 BAU/mL and >/=138 BAU/mL were related to the threshold for FRNT50 titers
      >/=20 against BA.1 and BA.2, respectively. A moderate correlation was observed
      between the sVNT and FRNT50 titers. At FRNT50 titers >/=20, the predicted sVNT
      for BA.1 and BA.2 was >/=10.57% and >/=11.52%, respectively. The study identified
      anti-RBD IgG and sVNT levels that predict detectable neutralizing antibodies
      against omicron variants. Assessment and monitoring of protective immunity
      support vaccine policies and will help identify optimal timing for booster
      vaccination.

TI  - Time-dependent force of infection and effective reproduction ratio in an
      age-structure dengue transmission model in Bandung City, Indonesia.
PG  - 430-447
LID - 10.1016/j.idm.2022.07.001 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus infection is a leading health problem in many endemic countries,
      including Indonesia, characterized by high morbidity and wide spread. It is known
      that the risk factors that influence the transmission intensity vary among
      different age groups, which can have implications for dengue control strategies. 
      A time-dependent four - age structure model of dengue transmission was
      constructed in this study. A vaccination scenario as control strategy was also
      applied to one of the age groups. Daily incidence data of dengue cases from Santo
      Borromeus Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia, from 2014 to 2016 was used to estimate
      the infection rate. We used two indicators to identify the changes in dengue
      transmission intensity for this period in each age group: the annual force of
      infection (FoI) and the effective reproduction ratio based on a time-dependent
      transmission rate. The results showed that the yearly FoI of children (age 0-4
      years) increased significantly from 2014 to 2015, at 10.08%. Overall, the highest
      FoI before and after vaccination occurred in youngsters (age 5-14 years), with a 
      FoI of about 6% per year. In addition, based on the daily effective reproduction 
      ratio, it was found that vaccination of youngsters could reduce the number of
      dengue cases in Bandung city faster than vaccination of children.

TI  - Epidemiology of Mosquito-Borne Viruses in Egypt: A Systematic Review.
LID - 1577 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071577 [doi]
AB  - There are at least five common mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs) recorded in Egypt,
      including dengue virus (DENV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), West Nile virus
      (WNV), Chikungunya virus, and Sindbis virus. Unexpected outbreaks caused by MBVs 
      reflect the deficiencies of the MBV surveillance system in Egypt. This systematic
      review characterized the epidemiology of MBV prevalence in Egypt. Human, animal, 
      and vector prevalence studies on MBVs in Egypt were retrieved from Web of
      Science, PubMed, and Bing Scholar, and 33 eligible studies were included for
      further analyses. The monophyletic characterization of the RVFV and WNV strains
      found in Egypt, which spans about half a century, suggests that both RVFV and WNV
      are widely transmitted in this nation. Moreover, the seropositive rates of DENV
      and WNV in hosts were on the rise in recent years, and spillover events of DENV
      and WNV to other countries from Egypt have been recorded. The common drawback for
      surveillance of MBVs in Egypt is the lack of seroprevalence studies on MBVs,
      especially in this century. It is necessary to evaluate endemic transmission
      risk, establish an early warning system for MBVs, and develop a sound joint
      system for medical care and public health for managing MBVs in Egypt.

TI  - Genetic Adaptation by Dengue Virus Serotype 2 to Enhance Infection of Aedes
      aegypti Mosquito Midguts.
LID - 1569 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071569 [doi]
AB  - Dengue viruses (DENVs), serotypes 1-4, are arthropod-borne viruses transmitted to
      humans by mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti. The transmission cycle begins when
      Ae. aegypti ingest blood from a viremic human and the virus infects midgut
      epithelial cells. In studying viruses derived from the DENV2 infectious clone
      30P-NBX, we found that when the virus was delivered to female Ae. aegypti in an
      infectious blood meal, the midgut infection rate (MIR) was very low. To determine
      if adaptive mutations in the DENV2 envelope (E) glycoprotein could be induced to 
      increase the MIR, we serially passed 30P-NBX in Ae. aegypti midguts. After four
      passages, a single, non-conservative mutation in E protein domain II (DII)
      nucleotide position 1300 became dominant, resulting in replacement of
      positively-charged amino acid lysine (K) at position 122 with negatively-charged 
      glutamic acid (E; K122E) and a significantly-enhanced MIR. Site directed
      mutagenesis experiments showed that reducing the positive charge of this
      surface-exposed region of the E protein DII correlated with improved Ae. aegypti 
      midgut infection.

TI  - Arboviral Infections in Neurological Disorders in Hospitalized Patients in Sao
      Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
LID - 1488 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071488 [doi]
AB  - Arbovirus infections are increasingly important causes of disease, whose spectrum
      of neurological manifestations are not fully known. This study sought to
      retrospectively assess the incidence of arboviruses in cerebrospinal fluid
      samples of patients with neurological symptoms to inform diagnosis of central and
      peripheral nervous system disorders. A total of 255 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      samples collected from January 2016 to December 2017 were tested for dengue virus
      (DENV 1-4), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in addition to other
      neurotropic arboviruses of interest, using genetic and serologic assays. Of the
      255 CSF samples analyzed, 3.53% (09/255) were positive for arboviruses presenting
      mainly as meningitis, encephalitis, and cerebrovascular events, of which ZIKV was
      detected in 2.74% (7/255), DENV in 0.78% (2/255), in addition to an identified
      ILHV infection that was described previously. All the cases were detected in
      adults aged 18 to 74 years old. Our findings highlight the scientific and
      clinical importance of neurological syndromes associated with arboviruses and
      demonstrate the relevance of specific laboratory methods to achieve accurate
      diagnoses as well as highlight the true dimension of these diseases to ultimately
      improve public health planning and medical case management.

TI  - Combination of E- and NS1-Derived DNA Vaccines: The Immune Response and
      Protection Elicited in Mice against DENV2.
LID - 1452 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071452 [doi]
AB  - The occurrence of dengue disease has increased radically in recent decades.
      Previously, we constructed the pE1D2 and pcTPANS1 DNA vaccines encoding the DENV2
      envelope (E) and non-structural 1 (NS1) proteins, respectively. To decrease the
      number of plasmids in a tetravalent candidate vaccine, we constructed a
      bicistronic plasmid, pNS1/E/D2, encoding these two proteins simultaneously. We
      evaluated the protective immunity induced in mice vaccinated with the pNS1/E/D2
      candidate and compared to the responses elicited by immunization with the former 
      vaccines isolated or in combination. We transfected BHK-21 cells with the
      different plasmids and detected recombinant proteins by immunofluorescence and
      mass spectrometry assays to confirm antigen expression. BALB/c mice were
      inoculated with the DNA vaccines followed by a lethal DENV2 challenge. ELISA,
      PRNT50, and IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays were performed for the investigation of the 
      humoral and cellular responses. We observed the concomitant expression of NS1 and
      E proteins in pNS1/E/D2-transfected cells. All E-based vaccines induced anti-E
      and neutralizing antibodies. However, anti-NS1 antibodies were only observed
      after immunization with the pcTPANS1 administered alone or combined with pE1D2.
      In contrast, splenocytes from pNS1/E/D2- or pcTPANS1 + pE1D2-vaccinated animals
      responded to NS1- and E-derived synthetic peptides. All the DNA vaccines
      conferred protection against DENV2.

TI  - Chikungunya Virus Asian Lineage Infection in the Amazon Region Is Maintained by
      Asiatic and Caribbean-Introduced Variants.
LID - 1445 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071445 [doi]
AB  - The simultaneous transmission of two lineages of the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)
      was discovered after the pathogen's initial arrival in Brazil. In Oiapoque (Amapa
      state, north Brazil), the Asian lineage (CHIKV-Asian) was discovered, while in
      Bahia state, the East-Central-South-African lineage (CHIKV-ECSA) was discovered
      (northeast Brazil). Since then, the CHIKV-Asian lineage has been restricted to
      the Amazon region (mostly in the state of Amapa), whereas the ECSA lineage has
      expanded across the country. Despite the fact that the Asian lineage was already 
      present in the Amazon region, the ECSA lineage brought from the northeast caused 
      a large outbreak in the Amazonian state of Roraima (north Brazil) in 2017. Here, 
      CHIKV spread in the Amazon region was studied by a Zika-Dengue-Chikungunya PCR
      assay in 824 serum samples collected between 2013 and 2016 from individuals with 
      symptoms of viral infection in the Amapa state. We found 11 samples positive for 
      CHIKV-Asian, and, from these samples, we were able to retrieve 10 full-length
      viral genomes. A comprehensive phylogenetic study revealed that nine CHIKV
      sequences came from a local transmission cluster related to Caribbean strains,
      whereas one sequence was related to sequences from the Philippines. These
      findings imply that CHIKV spread in different ways in Roraima and Amapa, despite 
      the fact that both states had similar climatic circumstances and mosquito vector 
      frequencies.

TI  - Dynamic Interactions of Post Cleaved NS2B Cofactor and NS3 Protease Identified by
      Integrative Structural Approaches.
LID - 1440 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071440 [doi]
AB  - Diseases caused by flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile Virus
      (WNV), are a serious threat to public health. The flavivirus single-stranded RNA 
      genome is translated into a polyprotein which is cleaved into three structural
      proteins and seven non-structural proteins by the viral and cellular proteases.
      Non-structural (NS) protein 3 is a multifunctional protein that has N-terminal
      protease and C-terminal helicase domains. The NS3 protease requires co-factor
      NS2B for enzymatic activity and folding. Due to its essential role in viral
      replication, NS2B-NS3 protease is an attractive target for antiviral drugs.
      Despite the availability of crystal structures, dynamic interactions of the N-
      and C-termini of NS2B co-factor have been elusive due to their flexible fold. In 
      this study, we employ integrative structural approaches combined with biochemical
      assays to elucidate the dynamic interactions of the flexible DENV4 NS2B and NS3
      N- and C-termini. We captured the crystal structure of self-cleaved DENV4
      NS2B47NS3 protease in post cleavage state. The intermediate conformation adopted 
      in the reported structure can be targeted by allosteric inhibitors. Comparison of
      our new findings from DENV4 against previously studied ZIKV NS2B-NS3 proteins
      reveals differences in NS2B-NS3 function between the two viruses. No inhibition
      of protease activity was observed for unlinked DENV NS2B-NS3 in presence of the
      cleavage site while ZIKV NS2B-NS3 cleavage inhibits protease activity. Another
      difference is that binding of the NS2B C-terminus to DENV4 eNS2B47NS3Pro active
      site is mediated via interactions with P4-P6 residues while for ZIKV, the binding
      of NS2B C-terminus to active site is mediated by P1-P3 residues. The mapping of
      NS2B N- and C-termini with NS3 indicates that these intermolecular interactions
      occur mainly on the beta-barrel 2 of the NS3 protease domain. Our integrative
      approach enables a comprehensive understanding of the folding and dynamic
      interactions of DENV NS3 protease and its cofactor NS2B.

TI  - Transcriptional and Translational Dynamics of Zika and Dengue Virus Infection.
LID - 1418 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071418 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are members of the Flaviviridae family 
      of RNA viruses and cause severe disease in humans. ZIKV and DENV share over 90%
      of their genome sequences, however, the clinical features of Zika and dengue
      infections are very different reflecting tropism and cellular effects. Here, we
      used simultaneous RNA sequencing and ribosome footprinting to define the
      transcriptional and translational dynamics of ZIKV and DENV infection in human
      neuronal progenitor cells (hNPCs). The gene expression data showed induction of
      aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARS) and the translation activating PIM1 kinase,
      indicating an increase in RNA translation capacity. The data also reveal
      activation of different cell stress responses, with ZIKV triggering a BACH1/2
      redox program, and DENV activating the ATF/CHOP endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
      program. The RNA translation data highlight activation of polyamine metabolism
      through changes in key enzymes and their regulators. This pathway is needed for
      eIF5A hypusination and has been implicated in viral translation and replication. 
      Concerning the viral RNA genomes, ribosome occupancy readily identified highly
      translated open reading frames and a novel upstream ORF (uORF) in the DENV
      genome. Together, our data highlight both the cellular stress response and the
      activation of RNA translation and polyamine metabolism during DENV and ZIKV
      infection.

LID - 10.3390/v14071394 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus, the causative agent of dengue fever, life-threatening hemorrhagic
      fever, and shock syndrome, is mainly transmitted to humans through mosquito
      vectors. It can also be transmitted through atypical routes, including needle
      stick injury, vertical transmission, blood transfusion, and organ
      transplantation. In addition, sporadic cases which have no clear infectious
      causes have raised the respiratory exposure concerns, and the risks remain
      unclear. Here, we analyze the respiratory infectivity of the dengue virus in
      BALB/c suckling and adult immunodeficient mice by the intranasal inoculation of
      dengue virus serotype 2. The infected mice presented with clinical symptoms,
      including excitement, emaciation, malaise, and death. Viremia was detected for 3 
      days post inoculation. Histopathological changes were observed in the brain,
      liver, and spleen. The virus showed evident brain tropism post inoculation and
      viral loads peaked at 7 days post inoculation. Furthermore, the virus was
      isolated from the infected mice; the sequence homology between the origin and
      isolates was 99.99%. Similar results were observed in adult IFN-alpha/beta
      receptor-deficient mice. Overall, dengue virus can infect suckling mice and adult
      immune-deficient mice via the nasal route. This study broadens our perception of 
      atypical dengue transmission routes and provides evidence of nasal transmission
      of dengue virus in the absence of mosquito vectors.

TI  - A Retrospective Study of the Seroprevalence of Dengue Virus and Chikungunya Virus
      Exposures in Nigeria, 2010-2018.
LID - 762 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070762 [doi]
AB  - Arboviruses are important public health threats in many regions of the world.
      Nigeria has experienced outbreaks of arboviruses over the past decades, leading
      to concerns of widespread endemicity, which are frequently misdiagnosed. This
      study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of dengue virus (DENV) (a flavivirus)
      and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (an alphavirus) infections in three major
      population centers of Nigeria. A convenience sample of 701 sera was collected
      from both healthy and febrile participants between August 2010 and March 2018.
      Sera were tested for prior exposure to CHIKV virus and DENV using indirect IgG
      ELISA. Results showed that 54.1% (379/701) of participants were seropositive for 
      anti-DENV antibodies, 41.3% (290/701) were seropositive for anti-CHIKV
      antibodies, and 20.1% (141/701) had previous exposure to both. The seropositivity
      for prior CHIKV exposure and prior exposure to DENV and CHIKV was significantly
      associated with age (CHIKV: OR = 2.7 (95% CI: 1.7-4.3); DENV and CHIKV: OR = 2.2 
      (95% CI: 1.2-4.0) for adults compared to participants under 18 years old).
      Overall, the high seropositivity across all age groups suggests that arboviral
      infections are prevalent in Nigeria and indicates that surveillance and further
      epidemiological studies are required to determine the true burden of these
      infections and the spectrum of diseases associated with these exposures.

TI  - Serological Evidence of Zika Virus Circulation in Burkina Faso.
LID - 741 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070741 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are two closely related members of the 
      Flaviviridae family, both transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, and are
      among the arboviruses most at risk to human health. Burkina Faso has been facing 
      an upsurge in DENV outbreaks since 2013. Unlike DENV, there is no serological
      evidence of ZIKV circulation in humans in Burkina Faso. The main objective of our
      study was to determine the seroprevalence of ZIKV and DENV in blood donors in
      Burkina Faso. A total of 501 donor samples collected in the two major cities of
      the country in 2020 were first tested by a competitive enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay to detect flavivirus antibodies. Positive sera were then
      tested using Luminex to detect ZIKV and DENV antibodies and virus-specific
      microneutralization tests against ZIKV were performed. The ZIKV seroprevalence
      was 22.75% in the donor samples and we found seropositivity for all
      DENV-serotypes ranging from 19.56% for DENV-1 to 48.86% for DENV-2. Molecular
      analyses performed on samples from febrile patients and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes 
      between 2019 and 2021 were negative. Our study showed the important circulation
      of ZIKV and DENV detected by serology although molecular evidence of the
      circulation of ZIKV could not be demonstrated. It is essential to strengthen
      existing arbovirus surveillance in Burkina Faso and more broadly in West Africa
      by focusing on fevers of unknown origin and integrating vector surveillance to
      assess the extent of ZIKV circulation and identify the circulating strain.
      Further studies are needed to better understand the epidemiology of this virus in
      order to define appropriate prevention and response methods.

TI  - Styrylpyrone Derivative (SPD) Extracted from Goniothalamus umbrosus Binds to
      Dengue Virus Serotype-2 Envelope Protein and Inhibits Early Stage of Virus
      Replication.
LID - 4566 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144566 [doi]
AB  - A study was conducted to investigate the anti-viral effect of a styrylpyrone
      derivative (SPD) called goniothalamin and the effects on the dengue virus
      serotype 2 (DENV-2) replication cycle. The SPD was prepared from the root of
      Goniothalamus umbrosus after purification with petroleum ether. The isolated SPD 
      was then subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and nuclear
      magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses for structure validation. The cytotoxicity of
      the SPD was evaluated using a cell viability assay, while the anti-viral activity
      of the SPD towards DENV-2 was confirmed by conducting a foci reduction assay
      which involved virus yield reduction, time-of-addition, and time removal assays. 
      Transcriptomic analysis via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (qRT-PCR) using the DENV-2 E gene was conducted to investigate the level of gene 
      transcript. Immunocytochemistry analysis was used to investigate the effects of
      SPD treatment on protein E expression. Finally, software molecular docking of the
      SPD and E protein was also performed. The cytotoxicity assay confirmed that the
      SPD was not toxic to Vero cells, even at the highest concentration tested. In the
      time-of-addition assay, more than 80% foci reduction was observed when SPDs were 
      administered at 2 h post-infection (hpi), and the reduction percentage then
      dropped with the delay of the treatment time, suggesting the inhibition of the
      early replication cycle. However, the time removal assay showed that more than
      80% reduction could only be observed after 96 h post-treatment with the SPD.
      Treatment with the SPD reduced the progeny infectivity when treated for 24 h and 
      was dose-dependent. The result showed that transcript level of the E gene in
      infected cells treated with the SPD was reduced compared to infected cells
      without treatment. In immunocytochemistry analysis, the DENV-2 E protein
      exhibited similar expression trends, shown by the gene transcription level.
      Molecular docking showed that the SPD can interact with E protein through
      hydrogen bonds and other interactions. Overall, this study showed that SPDs have 
      the potential to be anti-DENV-2 via a reduction in viral progeny infectivity and 
      a reduction in the expression of the DENV-2 E gene and protein at different
      phases of viral replication. SPDs should be further researched to be developed
      into an effective anti-viral treatment, particularly for early-phase dengue viral
      infection.

TI  - A Chikungunya Virus Multiepitope Recombinant Protein Expressed from the Binary
      System Insect Cell/Recombinant Baculovirus Is Useful for Laboratorial Diagnosis
      of Chikungunya.
LID - 1451 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071451 [doi]
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arbovirus currently distributed worldwide,
      causing a disease that shares clinical signs and symptoms with other illnesses,
      such as dengue and Zika and leading to a challenging clinical differential
      diagnosis. In Brazil, CHIKV emerged in 2014 with the simultaneous introduction of
      both Asian and East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotypes. Laboratorial
      diagnosis of CHIKV is mainly performed by molecular and serological assays, with 
      the latter more widely used. Although many commercial kits are available, their
      costs are still high for many underdeveloped and developing countries where the
      virus circulates. Here we described the development and evaluation of a
      multi-epitope recombinant protein-based IgG-ELISA (MULTREC IgG-ELISA) test for
      the specific detection of anti-CHIKV antibodies in clinical samples, as an
      alternative approach for laboratorial diagnosis. The MULTREC IgG-ELISA showed
      86.36% of sensitivity and 100% of specificity, and no cross-reactivity with other
      exanthematic diseases was observed. The recombinant protein was expressed from
      the binary system insect cell/baculovirus using the crystal-forming baculoviral
      protein polyhedrin as a carrier of the target recombinant protein to facilitate
      recovery. The crystals were at least 10 times smaller in size and had an
      amorphous shape when compared to the polyhedrin wild-type crystal. The assay uses
      a multi-epitope antigen, representing two replicates of 18 amino acid sequences
      from the E2 region and a sequence of 17 amino acids from the nsP3 region of
      CHIKV. The recombinant protein was highly expressed, easy to purify and has
      demonstrated its usefulness in confirming chikungunya exposure, indeed showing a 
      good potential tool for epidemiological surveillance.

TI  - Persistence of Metabolomic Changes in Patients during Post-COVID Phase: A
      Prospective, Observational Study.
LID - 641 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12070641 [doi]
AB  - Several relatively recently published studies have shown changes in plasma
      metabolites in various viral diseases such as Zika, Dengue, RSV or SARS-CoV-1.
      The aim of this study was to analyze the metabolome profile of patients during
      acute COVID-19 approximately one month after the acute infection and to compare
      these results with healthy (SARS-CoV-2-negative) controls. The metabolome
      analysis was performed by NMR spectroscopy from the peripheral blood of patients 
      and controls. The blood samples were collected on 3 different occasions (at
      admission, during hospitalization and on control visit after discharge from the
      hospital). When comparing sample groups (based on the date of acquisition) to
      controls, there is an indicative shift in metabolomics features based on the time
      passed after the first sample was taken towards controls. Based on the random
      forest algorithm, there is a strong discriminatory predictive value between
      controls and different sample groups (AUC equals 1 for controls versus samples
      taken at admission, Mathew correlation coefficient equals 1). Significant
      metabolomic changes persist in patients more than a month after acute SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. The random forest algorithm shows very strong discrimination (almost
      ideal) when comparing metabolite levels of patients in two various stages of
      disease and during the recovery period compared to SARS-CoV-2-negative controls.

TI  - New Anti-Flavivirus Fusion Loop Human Antibodies with Zika Virus-Neutralizing
      Potential.
LID - 7805 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147805 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus infections exhibit recurrent outbreaks and can be responsible for
      disease complications such as congenital Zika virus syndrome. Effective
      therapeutic interventions are still a challenge. Antibodies can provide
      significant protection, although the antibody response may fail due to
      antibody-dependent enhancement reactions. The choice of the target antigen is a
      crucial part of the process to generate effective neutralizing antibodies. Human 
      anti-Zika virus antibodies were selected by phage display technology. The
      antibodies were selected against a mimetic peptide based on the fusion loop
      region in the protein E of Zika virus, which is highly conserved among different 
      flaviviruses. Four rounds of selection were performed using the synthetic peptide
      in two strategies: the first was using the acidic elution of bound phages, and
      the second was by applying a competing procedure. After panning, the selected VH 
      and VL domains were determined by combining NGS and bioinformatic approaches.
      Three different human monoclonal antibodies were expressed as scFvs and further
      characterized. All showed a binding capacity to Zika (ZIKV) and showed
      cross-recognition with yellow fever (YFV) and dengue (DENV) viruses. Two of these
      antibodies, AZ1p and AZ6m, could neutralize the ZIKV infection in vitro. Due to
      the conservation of the fusion loop region, these new antibodies can potentially 
      be used in therapeutic intervention against Zika virus and other flavivirus
      illnesses.

TI  - Trypsin-like Inhibitor Domain (TIL)-Harboring Protein Is Essential for Aedes
      aegypti Reproduction.
LID - 7736 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147736 [doi]
AB  - Cysteine-rich trypsin inhibitor-like domain (TIL)-harboring proteins are broadly 
      distributed in nature but remain understudied in vector mosquitoes. Here we have 
      explored the biology of a TIL domain-containing protein of the arbovirus vector
      Aedes aegypti, cysteine-rich venom protein 379 (CRVP379). CRVP379 was previously 
      shown to be essential for dengue virus infection in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Gene 
      expression analysis showed CRVP379 to be highly expressed in pupal stages, male
      testes, and female ovaries. CRVP379 expression is also increased in the ovaries
      at 48 h post-blood feeding. We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to generate two
      mutant lines of CRVP379 with mutations inside or outside the TIL domain. Female
      mosquitoes from both mutant lines showed severe defects in their reproductive
      capability; mutant females also showed differences in their follicular cell
      morphology. However, the CRVP379 line with a mutation outside the TIL domain did 
      not affect male reproductive performance, suggesting that some CRVP379 residues
      may have sexually dimorphic functions. In contrast to previous reports, we did
      not observe a noticeable difference in dengue virus infection between the
      wild-type and any of the mutant lines. The importance of CRVP379 in Ae. aegypti
      reproductive biology makes it an interesting candidate for the development of Ae.
      aegypti population control methods.

TI  - Survivorship-Reducing Effect of Propylene Glycol on Vector Mosquito Populations
      and Its Potential Use in Attractive Toxic Sugar Baits.
LID - 595 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects13070595 [doi]
AB  - Arthropod control mechanisms are a vital part of public health measures around
      the world as many insect species serve as vectors for devastating human diseases.
      Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) is a widely distributed, medically important
      mosquito species that transmits viruses such as yellow fever, Dengue, and Zika.
      Many traditional control mechanisms have become less effective due to insecticide
      resistance or exhibit unwanted off-target effects, and, consequently, there is a 
      need for novel solutions. The use of attractive toxic sugar baits (ATSBs) has
      increased in recent years, though the toxic elements are often harmful to humans 
      and other vertebrates. Therefore, we are investigating propylene glycol, a
      substance that is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) for human consumption. Using 
      a series of feeding assays, we found that propylene glycol is highly toxic to Ae.
      aegypti adults and a single day of exposure significantly reduces the
      survivorship of test populations compared with controls. The effects are more
      pronounced in males, drastically reducing their survivorship after one day of
      consumption. Additionally, the consumption of propylene glycol reduced the
      survivorship of two prominent disease vectors: Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894) and
      Culex pipiens (Linnaeus, 1758). These findings indicate that propylene glycol
      could be used as a safe and effective alternative to pesticides in an ATSB
      system.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of Various Immunochromatographic Tests for NS1 Antigen and
      IgM Antibodies Detection in Acute Dengue Virus Infection.
LID - 8756 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148756 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were evaluated, in this paper, for
      their utility as a reliable test, using resource-constrained studies. In most
      studies, NS1 antigen and immunoglobulin M (IgM)-based immunochromatographic tests
      (ICTs) were considered for acute phase detection. We aimed to evaluate the
      diagnostic accuracy of NS1, IgM, and NS1/IgM-based ICTs to detect acute dengue
      virus (DENV) infection in dengue-endemic regions. METHODS: Studies were
      electronically identified using the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase,
      Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CINAHL Plus. Keywords including dengue,
      rapid diagnostic test, immunochromatography, sensitivity, specificity, and
      diagnosis were applied across databases. In total, 15 studies were included.
      Quality assessment of the included studies was performed using the QUADAS-2 tool.
      All statistical analyses were conducted using RevMan, MedCalc, and SPSS software.
      RESULTS: The studies revealed a total of 4135 individuals, originating largely
      from the Americas and Asia. The prevalence of DENV cases was 53.8%. Pooled
      sensitivities vs. specificities for NS1 (only), IgM (only) and combined NS1/IgM
      were 70.97% vs. 94.73%, 40.32% vs. 93.01%, and 78.62% vs. 88.47%, respectively.
      Diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of DENV for NS1 ICTs was 43.95 (95% CI: 36.61-52.78),
      for IgM only ICTs was 8.99 (95% CI: 7.25-11.16), and for NS1/IgM ICTs was 28.22
      (95% CI: 24.18-32.95). ELISA ICTs yielded a DOR of 21.36, 95% CI: 17.08-26.741.
      RT-PCR had a DOR of 40.43, 95% CI: 23.3-71.2. Heterogeneity tests for subgroup
      analysis by ICT manufacturers for NS1 ICTs revealed an chi(2) finding of 158.818 
      (df = 8), p &lt; 0.001, whereas for IgM ICTs, the chi(2) finding was 21.698 (df =
      5), p &lt; 0.001. CONCLUSION: NS1-based ICTs had the highest diagnostic accuracy 
      in acute phases of DENV infection. Certain factors influenced the pooled
      sensitivity, including ICT manufacturers, nature of the infection, reference
      method (RT-PCR), and serotypes. Prospective studies may examine the best strategy
      for incorporating ICTs for dengue diagnosis.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices in Relation to Mosquito-Borne Diseases in
      Bangladesh.
LID - 8258 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148258 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) such as dengue, malaria, and chikungunya are
      common in Bangladesh, with frequent outbreaks in the rainy season. Analysis of
      the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of people toward any crisis is
      fundamental to addressing any gap. Here, we conducted a cross-sectional study
      mainly focusing on the northern, southern and central parts of Bangladesh to
      understand the level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices of people regarding
      MBDs, mosquito habitats, or control measures. A total of 1720 participants were
      involved in the study from 33 out of 64 districts of Bangladesh, of which 56.9%
      were male. While most of them knew about dengue (97.1%), chikungunya (81.4%), and
      malaria (85.2%), only half of them were aware of filaria (53.3%), which is
      endemic to the northern region. A knowledge score (0-8, low), (9-16, moderate),
      (17-24, high), and attitude score (0-4, poor), (5-8, moderate), and (9-13, high) 
      were assigned. While poor and moderate attitudes were considered negative, good
      attitudes were considered positive. About 45% of the respondents had a moderate
      knowledge score (50-70); however, about 67.9% of participants showed a good
      attitude score (&gt;70) towards the control of MBDs. It was found that the
      knowledge and attitude of the responders were related to their profession
      (knowledge p &lt; 0.001; attitude, p = 0.002), residential area (knowledge p &lt;
      0.001; attitude, p &lt; 0.001), and education level (knowledge p &lt; 0.001;
      attitude p = 0.004). A mosquito is a kind of nuisance bug, and about 79.8% of
      responders admitted that they kill mosquitoes as soon as they notice them. They
      also use bed nets (93.7%) followed by mosquito coils (85.7%) as a preventive
      method. Interestingly, 73.2% of the responders were reluctant to contact the
      local government during an increase in mosquito numbers. Overall, the people of
      Bangladesh have a positive attitude towards the prevention of mosquito-borne
      diseases. It is highly recommended that the government creates more knowledge
      regarding this issue and develops collaborative approaches with local people to
      implement robust preventive measures against mosquito-borne diseases.

TI  - Development of a Rapid Gold Nanoparticle-Based Lateral Flow Immunoassay for the
      Detection of Dengue Virus.
LID - 495 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12070495 [doi]
AB  - Flavivirus detection in humans and mosquito reservoirs has been an important
      issue since it can cause a variety of illnesses and could represent a health
      problem in geographical zones where the vector is endemic. In this work, we
      designed and characterized a biosensor based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and
      antibody 4G2 for the detection of dengue virus (DENV) in vitro, obtaining
      different conjugates (with different antibody concentrations). The AuNP-4G2
      conjugates at concentrations of 1, 3, and 6 microg/mL presented an increase in
      the average hydrodynamic diameter compared to the naked AuNPs. Also, as part of
      the characterization, differences in the UV-Vis absorbance spectrum and
      electrophoretic migration were observed between the conjugated AuNPs (with BSA or
      antibody) and naked AuNPs. Additionally, we used this biosensor (AuNP-4G2
      conjugate with 3 microg/mL antibody) in the assembly of a competitive lateral
      flow assay (LFA) for the development of an alternative test to detect the
      flavivirus envelope protein in isolated DENV samples as a future tool for dengue 
      detection (and other flaviviruses) in the mosquito vector (Aedesaegypti) for the 
      identification of epidemic risk regions. Functionality tests were performed using
      Dengue virus 2 isolated solution (TCID50/mL = 4.58 x 10(3)) as a positive sample 
      and PBS buffer as a negative control. The results showed that it is possible to
      detect Dengue virus in vitro with this gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow assay
      with an estimated detection limit of 5.12 x 10(2) PFU. We suggest that this
      biosensor could be used as an additional detection tool by coupling it to
      different point-of-care tests (POCT) for the easy detection of other
      flaviviruses.

TI  - Arbovirus risk perception as a predictor of mosquito-bite preventive behaviors in
      Ponce, Puerto Rico.
PG  - e0010653
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010653 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-borne arboviruses are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
      the Caribbean. In Puerto Rico, chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses have each
      caused large outbreaks during 2010-2022. To date, the majority of control
      measures to prevent these diseases focus on mosquito control and many require
      community participation. In 2018, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention launched the COPA project, a community-based cohort study in Ponce,
      Puerto Rico, to measure the impact of novel vector control interventions in
      reducing arboviral infections. Randomly selected households from 38 designated
      cluster areas were offered participation, and baseline data were collected from
      2,353 households between May 2018 and May 2019. Household-level responses were
      provided by one representative per home. Cross-sectional analyses of baseline
      data were conducted to estimate 1) the association between arboviral risk
      perception and annual household expenditure on mosquito control, and 2) the
      association between arboviral risk perception and engagement in >/=3
      household-level risk reduction behaviors. In this study, 27% of household
      representatives believed their household was at high risk of arboviruses and 36% 
      of households engaged in at least three of the six household-level preventive
      behaviors. Households where the representative perceived their household at high 
      risk spent an average of $35.9 (95% confidence interval: $23.7, $48.1) more
      annually on mosquito bite prevention compared to households where the
      representative perceived no risk. The probability of engaging in >/=3
      household-level mosquito-preventive behaviors was 10.2 percentage points greater 
      (7.2, 13.0) in households where the representatives perceived high risk compared 
      to those in which the representatives perceived no risk. Paired with other
      research, these results support investment in community-based participatory
      approaches to mosquito control and providing accessible information for
      communities to accurately interpret their risk.

TI  - Full genome analysis of circulating DENV-2 in Senegal reveals a regional
      diversification into separate clades.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28027 [doi]
AB  - To assess the genetic diversity of circulating dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) in
      Senegal, we analyzed nine newly generated complete genome of strains isolated
      during the 2018 outbreaks and 06 sequences obtained in 2018 and 2019 from Thies
      and Rosso, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Senegalese strains
      belonged to the Cosmopolitan genotype of DENV-2, but we observed intra-genotype
      variability leading to a divergence in two clades associated with specific
      geographic distribution. We report two DENV-2 variants belonging to two distinct 
      clades. Isolates from the "Northern clade" (n = 8) harbored three non-synonymous 
      mutations (V1183M, R1405K, P2266T) located respectively on NS2A, NS2B and NS4A,
      while isolates from the "Western clade" (n = 7) had two non-synonymous mutations 
      (V1185E, V3214E) located respectively in the NS2A and NS5 genes. These findings
      call for phylogeographic analysis to investigate routes of introductions,
      dispersal pattern and in-depth in-vitro and functional study to elucidate the
      impact of observed mutations on viral fitness, spread, epidemiology and
      pathology. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aedes-borne viruses, yellow fever, dengue, Chikungunya and Zika are taking a huge
      toll on global health as Africa faces re-emergence with potential for massive
      human catastrophe. Transmission driven by diverse vectors in ecological settings 
      that range from urban to rural and sylvatic habitats with human and non-human
      primate/reservoir activities across such habitats have facilitated virus movement
      and spill over to susceptible human populations. Approved vaccine exists for YF
      although availability for routine and mass vaccination is often constrained.
      Integrating vector surveillance, understanding disease ecology with rationalised 
      vaccination in high-risk areas (YF) remains important in disease prevention and
      control. We review trends in disease occurrence in Africa, hinting on gaps in
      disease detection and management and the prospects for prevention and/or control.

      Recent Literature.

LID - 10.3390/tropicalmed7070143 [doi]
AB  - Alongside peace, education, food, income, a stable ecosystem, sustainable
      resources and social justice, shelter is a prerequisite for health. According to 
      international human rights law, everyone is entitled to an adequate standard of
      living, which includes adequate housing. Adequate housing, including access to
      water and sanitation, plays a critical role in the prevention and management of
      neglected tropical diseases, which affect over 1 billion people worldwide.
      Inadequate housing conditions represent a risk factor for many of them, e.g.,
      Chagas disease that affects 6-8 million people worldwide, visceral leishmaniasis 
      that kills 20,000-30,000 people/year, lymphatic filariasis which threatens 859
      million people worldwide or dengue that has increased 8-10 fold over the last two
      decades. Vector control strategies for the above-mentioned diseases have shown
      their effectiveness and should include systematic and repetitive in-house
      spraying and individual protection (e.g., impregnated nets), as well as
      better-quality construction material and techniques and better sanitation
      infrastructures and practices. Access to adequate housing is a basic human right.
      The violation of the right to adequate housing may affect the enjoyment of other 
      human rights. Access to adequate housing can strengthen (and facilitate access
      to) other basic human rights, such as the rights to work, health, security, and
      education.

LID - 141 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/tropicalmed7070141 [doi]
AB  - Simultaneous spatial circulation of urban arboviral diseases, such as dengue,
      chikungunya, and Zika, is a major challenge. In this ecological study of urban
      arboviruses performed from 2015 to 2019, we analyzed the spatial and temporal
      dynamics of these arboviruses in all 92 municipalities and nine health regions of
      Rio de Janeiro state. Annual cumulative incidences are presented for all three
      arboviruses throughout the study period. Spatial analyses of the three studied
      arboviruses showed distinct behaviors among municipalities and health regions.
      Co-circulation of the three arboviruses in the state and a heterogeneous
      spatiotemporal pattern was observed for each disease and region, with dengue
      having a higher annual incidence during the five years of the study, as well as
      two consecutive epidemic years in the state. The increase in transmission in
      different regions of the state in one year culminated in an epidemic in the state
      in the following year. A high annual cumulative incidence of chikungunya occurred
      in municipalities from 2017 to 2019 and of Zika only in 2016. Some municipalities
      with higher population densities showed higher incidences for some arboviruses
      and appeared to contribute to the dissemination to cities of lower demographic
      density and maintenance of these urban arboviruses. Thus, regions recording
      increased incidences of the three diseases in their territories for long periods 
      should be considered municipal poles, as they initiated and sustained high
      transmission within their region.

AB  - Serology remains a useful indirect method of diagnosing tropical diseases,
      especially in dengue infection. However, the current literature regarding
      cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and dengue serology is limited and revealed
      conflicting results. As a means to uncover relevant serological insight involving
      antibody classes against SARS-CoV-2 and cross-reactivity, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA,
      IgM, and IgG ELISA, based on spike and nucleocapsid proteins, were selected for a
      fever-presenting tropical disease patient investigation. The study was conducted 
      at the Faculty of Tropical Medicine during March to December 2021. The study data
      source comprised (i) 170 non-COVID-19 sera from 140 adults and children
      presenting with acute undifferentiated febrile illness and 30 healthy volunteers,
      and (ii) 31 COVID-19 sera from 17 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Among 170
      non-COVID-19 samples, 27 were false positives (15.9%), of which IgA, IgM, and IgG
      cross-reactive antibody classes were detected in 18 (10.6%), 9 (5.3%), and 3
      (1.8%) cases, respectively. Interestingly, one case exhibited both IgA and IgM
      false positivity, while two cases exhibited both IgA and IgG false positivity.
      The false positivity rate in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgM was reported in adults
      with dengue infection (11.3% and 5%) and adults with other tropical diseases
      (16.7% and 13.3%). The urea dissociation method applied to mitigate false
      positivity resulted in significantly decreased ELISA-based false and true
      positives. In conclusion, the analysis of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in sera of 
      patients with different tropical diseases showed that high IgA and IgM false
      positivity thus potentially limits serological assay utility in fever-presenting 
      patients in tropical areas.

AB  - We report the first pediatric disease in which the use of minimally invasive
      autopsy (MIA) confirmed severe dengue as the cause of death. During the COVID-19 
      pandemic, a previously healthy 10-year-old girl living in north-eastern Brazil
      presented fever, headache, diffuse abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and vomiting. On
      the fourth day, the clinical symptoms worsened and the patient died. An MIA was
      performed, and cores of brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and spleen were
      collected with 14G biopsy needles. Microscopic examination showed diffuse oedema 
      and congestion, pulmonary intra-alveolar haemorrhage, small foci of midzonal
      necrosis in the liver, and tubular cell necrosis in the kidneys. Dengue virus RNA
      and NS1 antigen were detected in blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples. Clinical,
      pathological, and laboratory findings, in combination with the absence of other
      lesions and microorganisms, allowed concluding that the patient had died from
      complications of severe dengue.

TI  - Observing the distribution of mosquito bites on humans to inform personal
      protection measures against malaria and dengue vectors.
PG  - e0271833
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271833 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding mosquito biting behaviours is important for designing
      and evaluating protection methods against nuisance biting and mosquito-borne
      diseases (e.g. dengue, malaria and zika). We investigated the preferred biting
      sites by Aedes aegypti and Anopheles arabiensis on adult volunteers in standing
      or sleeping positions; and estimated the theoretical protection limits affordable
      from protective clothing or repellent-treated footwear. METHODS: Adult volunteers
      dressed in shorts and t-shirts were exposed to infection-free laboratory-reared
      mosquitoes inside screened chambers from 6am to noon (for day-biting Ae. aegypti)
      or 6pm to midnight (night-biting An. arabiensis). Attempted bites on different
      body parts were recorded. Comparative observations were made on same volunteers
      while wearing sandals treated with transfluthrin, a vapour-phase pyrethroid that 
      kills and repels mosquitoes. RESULTS: An. arabiensis bites were mainly on the
      lower limbs of standing volunteers (95.9% of bites below the knees) but
      evenly-distributed over all exposed body surfaces when the volunteers were on
      sleeping positions (only 28.8% bites below knees). Ae. aegypti bites were
      slightly concentrated on lower limbs of standing volunteers (47.7% below knees), 
      but evenly-distributed on sleeping volunteers (23.3% below knees). Wearing
      protective clothing that leave only hands and head uncovered (e.g. socks +
      trousers + long-sleeved shirts) could theoretically prevent 78-83% of bites
      during sleeping, and at least 90% of bites during non-sleeping hours. If the feet
      are also exposed, protection declines to as low as 36.3% against Anopheles. The
      experiments showed that transfluthrin-treated sandals reduced An. arabiensis by
      54-86% and Ae. aegypti by 32-39%, but did not change overall distributions of
      bites. CONCLUSION: Biting by An. arabiensis and Ae. aegypti occur mainly on the
      lower limbs, though this proclivity is less pronounced in the Aedes species.
      However, when hosts are on sleeping positions, biting by both species is more
      evenly-distributed over the exposed body surfaces. High personal protection might
      be achieved by simply wearing long-sleeved clothing, though protection against
      Anopheles particularly requires covering of feet and lower legs. The
      transfluthrin-treated footwear can reduce biting risk, especially by An.
      arabiensis. These findings could inform the design and use of personal protection
      tools (both insecticidal and non-insecticidal) against mosquitoes and
      mosquito-borne diseases.

TI  - Engineering CRISPR/Cas13 System against RNA Viruses: From Diagnostics to
      Therapeutics.
LID - 291 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering9070291 [doi]
AB  - Over the past decades, RNA viruses have been threatened people's health and led
      to global health emergencies. Significant progress has been made in diagnostic
      methods and antiviral therapeutics for combating RNA viruses. ELISA and RT-qPCR
      are reliable methods to detect RNA viruses, but they suffer from time-consuming
      procedures and limited sensitivities. Vaccines are effective to prevent virus
      infection and drugs are useful for antiviral treatment, while both need a
      relatively long research and development cycle. In recent years, CRISPR-based
      gene editing and modifying tools have been expanded rapidly. In particular, the
      CRISPR-Cas13 system stands out from the CRISPR-Cas family due to its accurate
      RNA-targeting ability, which makes it a promising tool for RNA virus diagnosis
      and therapy. Here, we review the current applications of the CRISPR-Cas13 system 
      against RNA viruses, from diagnostics to therapeutics, and use some medically
      important RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, dengue virus, and HIV-1 as examples to 
      demonstrate the great potential of the CRISPR-Cas13 system.

TI  - Preclinical evaluation of [(18)F]FDG-PET as a biomarker of lymphoid tissue
      disease and inflammation in Zika virus infection.
LID - 10.1007/s00259-022-05892-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Zika (ZIKV) is a viral inflammatory disease affecting adults, children, 
      and developing fetuses. It is endemic to tropical and sub-tropical countries,
      resulting in half the global population at risk of infection. Despite this, there
      are no approved therapies or vaccines against ZIKV disease. Non-invasive imaging 
      biomarkers are potentially valuable tools for studying viral pathogenesis,
      prognosticating host response to disease, and evaluating in vivo efficacy of
      experimental therapeutic interventions. In this study, we evaluated
      [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) as an
      imaging biomarker of ZIKV disease in a mouse model and correlated metabolic
      tracer tissue uptake with real-time biochemical, virological, and inflammatory
      features of tissue infection. METHODS: [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT imaging was performed in
      an acute, lethal ZIKV mouse infection model, at increasing stages of disease
      severity. [(18)F]FDG-PET findings were corroborated with ex vivo
      wholemount-tissue autoradiography and tracer biodistribution studies. Tracer
      uptake was also correlated with in situ tissue disease status, including viral
      burden and inflammatory response. Immune profiling of the spleen by flow
      cytometry was performed to identify the immune cell subsets driving tissue
      pathology and enhancing tracer uptake in ZIKV disease. RESULTS: Foci of increased
      [(18)F]FDG uptake were consistently detected in lymphoid tissues-particularly the
      spleen-of ZIKV-infected animals. Splenic uptake increased with disease severity, 
      and corroborated findings in tissue pathology. Increased splenic uptake also
      correlated with increased viral replication and elevated expression of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines within these tissues. ZIKV-infected spleens were
      characterized by increased infiltration of myeloid cells, as well as increased
      proliferation of both myeloid and lymphoid cells. The increased cell
      proliferation correlated with increased tracer uptake in the spleen. Our findings
      support the use of [(18)F]FDG as an imaging biomarker to detect and track ZIKV
      disease in real time and highlight the dependency of affected tissue on the
      nature of the viral infection. CONCLUSION: [(18)F]FDG uptake in the spleen is a
      useful surrogate for interrogating in situ tissue viral burden and inflammation
      status in this ZIKV murine model.

TI  - Identification, Validation and Standardization of Bioactive Molecules Using
      UPLC/MS-QToF, UHPLC and HPTLC in Divya-Denguenil-Vati: A Penta-Herbal Formulation
      for Dengue Fever.
PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.1007/s10337-022-04183-7 [doi]
AB  - For the last fifty years, Dengue has been one of the most common mosquito-borne
      arboviral infections which has spread over the tropical and subtropical world.
      Divya-Denguenil-Vati (DNV) has been formulated by blending five specific herbs
      for effective resolution of Dengue fever. In the present study, we aimed to
      identify, develop, validate, and standardize methods for Divya-Denguenil-Vati
      (DNV), on UHPLC and HPTLC analytical platforms, with rapid, sensitive, accurate
      and rugged attributes. At first, 97 phyto-constituents were identified by
      UPLC/MS-QToF in Divya-Denguenil-Vati. UHPLC method was then developed and
      validated for simultaneous determination of gallic acid, 5-HMF, protocatechuic
      acid, magnoflorine, methyl gallate, berberine, rutin, ellagic acid, beta-ecdysone
      and rosmarinic acid in DNV. Four selected markers, gallic acid, rosmarinic acid, 
      magnoflorine and rutin were further developed and validated on HPTLC. Analytical 
      processes were validated as per ICH Q2 (R1) guidelines; and were found linear (r 
      (2) > 0.99), sensitive, precise (%RSD < 5%), and accurate, as indicated by high
      recovery values (88-105%). The limit of detection and quantification were also
      established for these phyto-metabolites, with their respective RSDs within 5%
      limits. Finally, these validated methods were employed to test twenty six
      different commercial batches of DNV. The quality, reproducibility and consistency
      of DNV have been well established using these developed and reliable analytical
      tools. These analytical strategies successfully set a path forward for robust
      quality evaluation and standardization of Divya-Denguenil-Vati, and other related
      herbal formulations. Supplementary Information: The online version contains

AB  - Introduction: Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are viral diseases that pose a
      constant threat to public health. These three arboviruses can produce very
      similar clinical pictures, which represents a challenge to achieving an accurate 
      clinical diagnosis and can lead to inadequate management and even fatal outcomes.
      Guidelines for the Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Dengue, Chikungunya, and
      Zika is part of the effort by the Pan American Health Organization and the
      countries of the Region of the Americas to prevent severe cases and death from
      these diseases, in a complex epidemiological context in which multiple factors
      favor transmission dynamics and lead to outbreaks and epidemics in the countries 
      of the Region. Objectives: Synthesize the recommendations in the PAHO guidelines,
      published in 2022, in order to present appropriate diagnosis and treatment of
      these arboviruses, and to address aspects of implementation of the
      recommendations. Methods: The guidelines and their recommendations were
      synthesized. In addition, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Lilacs,
      Health Systems Evidence, Epistemonikos, and gray literature for studies done in
      the Region of the Americas, in order to identify barriers, facilitators, and
      implementation strategies. Process and outcome indicators for implementation of
      the recommendations were identified and formulated. Results: We present 12
      recommendations applicable to adult and pediatric patients with suspected or
      confirmed dengue, chikungunya, or Zika, along with barriers, facilitators, and
      strategies for their implementation. Conclusions: The recommendations provide
      strategies for timely diagnosis and treatment of acute cases of dengue,
      chikungunya, and Zika, as well as considerations for implementation of the
      strategies.

AB  - The dynamics of host-virus interactions, and impairment of the host's immune
      surveillance by dengue virus (DENV) serotypes largely remain ambiguous. Several
      experimental and preclinical studies have demonstrated how the virus brings about
      severe disease by activating immune cells and other key elements of the
      inflammatory cascade. Plasmablasts are activated during primary and secondary
      infections, and play a determinative role in severe dengue. The cross-reactivity 
      of DENV immune responses with other flaviviruses can have implications both for
      cross-protection and severity of disease. The consequences of a cross-reactivity 
      between DENV and anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses are highly relevant in endemic areas. 
      Here, we review the latest progress in the understanding of dengue
      immunopathogenesis and provide suggestions to the development of target
      strategies against dengue.

AB  - Dengue is a tropical disease caused by the Dengue virus (DENV), a positive-sense,
      single stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae, which is transmitted by
      Aedes mosquitoes. The occurrence of dengue has grown dramatically around the
      globe in recent decades, and it is rapidly becoming a global burden. Furthermore,
      all four DENV serotypes cocirculate and create a problematic hyperendemic
      situation. Characteristic symptoms range from being asymptomatic, dengue fever to
      life-threatening complications such as hemorrhagic fever and shock. Apart from
      the inherent virulence of the virus strain, a dysregulated host immune response
      makes the condition worse. Currently, there is no highly recommended vaccine or
      therapeutic agent against dengue. With the advent of virus strains resistant to
      antiviral agents, there is a constant need for new therapies to be developed.
      Since time immemorial, human civilization has utilized plants in traditional
      medicine to treat various diseases, including infectious viral diseases. With the
      advancement in molecular biology, cell biology techniques, and bioinformatics,
      recent studies have tried to provide scientific evidence and determine the
      mechanism of anti-dengue activity of various plant extracts and plant-derived
      agents. The current Review consolidates the studies on the last 20 years of in
      vitro and in vivo experiments on the ethnomedicinal plants used against the
      dengue virus. Several active phytoconstituents like quercetin, castanospermine,
      alpha-mangostin, schisandrin-A, hirsutin have been found to be promising to
      inhibition of all the four DENV serotypes. However, novel therapeutics need to be
      reassessed in relevant cells using high-throughput techniques. Further, in vivo
      dose optimization for the immunomodulatory and antiviral activity should be
      examined on a vast sample size. Such a Review should help take the knowledge
      forward, validate it, and use medicinal plants in different combinations
      targeting multiple stages of virus infection for more effective multipronged
      therapy against dengue infection.

AB  - In addition to antibacterial effects, macrolide antibiotics exhibit other
      extensive pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory and antiviral
      activities. Erythromycin estolate, one of the macrolide antibiotics, was
      previously investigated to effectively inhibit infections of various flaviviruses
      including Zika virus, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus, but its antiviral
      effect against human coronavirus remains unknown. Thus, the current study was
      designed to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of erythromycin estolate against
      human coronavirus strain OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and to illustrate the underlying
      mechanisms. Erythromycin estolate effectively inhibited HCoV-OC43 infection in
      different cell types and significantly reduced virus titers at safe concentration
      without cell cytotoxicity. Furthermore, erythromycin estolate was identified to
      inhibit HCoV-OC43 infection at the early stage and to irreversibly inactivate
      virus by disrupting the integrity of the viral membrane whose lipid component
      might be the target of action. Together, it was demonstrated that erythromycin
      estolate could be a potential therapeutic drug for HCoV-OC43 infection.

AB  - More than half of the global population lives in areas where the Aedes aegypti
      mosquito is present. Efforts have been made to deal with the population of this
      mosquito in the larval and adult stages to prevent outbreaks of diseases (Dengue,
      Zika, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever). In this scenario, photodynamic inactivation
      may be an effective alternative method to control this vector population. To
      evaluate the efficacy of the riboflavin - B2 vitamin - as photosensitizer (PS) in
      the photodynamic inactivation of Ae. aegypti larvae, different concentrations (0;
      0.005; 0.010; 0.025; 0.050; 0.075 and 0.100 mg mL(-1)) were evaluated under white
      light from RGB LEDs at a light dose of 495.2 J cm(-2). The results reveal that
      riboflavin can be successfully applied as a PS agent to photoinactivate Ae.
      aegypti larvae, showing its potential to deal with the larvae population.

TI  - Multiple insecticide resistance and first evidence of V410L kdr mutation in Aedes
      (Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus) from Burkina Faso.
LID - 10.1111/mve.12602 [doi]
AB  - The response to recent dengue outbreaks in Burkina Faso was insecticide-based,
      despite poor knowledge of the vector population's susceptibility to the
      insecticides used. Here, we report on the susceptibility to the main insecticide 
      classes and identify important underlying mechanisms in Aedes aegypti populations
      in Ouagadougou and Banfora, in 2019 and 2020. Wild Ae. aegypti were tested as
      adults in WHO bioassays and then screened in real time melting curve qPCR
      analyses to genotype the F1534C, V1016I, and V410L Aedes kdr mutations. Ae.
      aegypti showed moderate resistance to 0.1% bendiocarb (80-95% survival
      post-exposure), 0.8% Malathion (60-100%), 0.21% pirimiphos-methyl (75% - 97%),
      and high resistance to 0.03% deltamethrin (20-70%). PBO pre-exposure partially
      restored pyrethroid susceptibility. Genotyping detected high frequency of 1534C
      allele (0.92) and moderate 1016I (0.1-0.32). The V410L mutation was detected in
      Burkina Faso for the first time (frequency 0.1-0.36). Mosquitoes surviving 4 h
      exposure to 0.03% deltamethrin had significantly higher frequencies of the F1534C
      mutation than dead mosquitoes (0.70 vs. 0.96, p < 0.0001) and mosquitoes
      surviving 2 - 4 h exposure had a significantly reduced life span. Ae. aegypti
      from Burkina Faso are resistant to multiple insecticide classes with multiple
      mechanisms involved, demonstrating the essential role of insecticide resistance
      monitoring within national dengue control programmes.

TI  - Does COVID-19 lockdowns have impacted on global dengue burden? A special focus to
      India.
PG  - 1402
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-13720-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The world has been battling several vector-borne diseases since time 
      immemorial. Socio-economic marginality, precipitation variations and human
      behavioral attributes play a major role in the proliferation of these diseases.
      Lockdown and social distancing have affected social behavioral aspects of human
      life and somehow impact on the spread of vector borne diseases. This article
      sheds light into the relationship between COVID-19 lockdown and global dengue
      burden with special focus on India. It also focuses on the interconnection of the
      COVID-19 pandemic (waves 1 and 2) and the alteration of human behavioral patterns
      in dengue cases. METHODS: We performed a systematic search using various
      resources from different platforms and websites, such as Medline; Pubmed; PAHO;
      WHO; CDC; ECDC; Epidemiology Unit Ministry of Health (Sri Lanka Government);
      NASA; NVBDCP from 2015 until 2021. We have included many factors, such as
      different geographical conditions (tropical climate, semitropic and arid
      conditions); GDP rate (developed nations, developing nations, and underdeveloped 
      nations). We also categorized our data in order to conform to COVID-19 duration
      from 2019 to 2021. Data was extracted for the complete duration of 10 years (2012
      to 2021) from various countries with different geographical region (arid region, 
      semitropic/semiarid region and tropical region). RESULTS: There was a noticeable 
      reduction in dengue cases in underdeveloped (70-85%), developing (50-90%), and
      developed nations (75%) in the years 2019 and 2021. The dengue cases drastically 
      reduced by 55-65% with the advent of COVID-19 s wave in the year 2021 across the 
      globe. CONCLUSIONS: At present, we can conclude that COVID-19 and dengue show an 
      inverse relationship. These preliminary, data-based observations should guide
      clinical practice until more data are made public and basis for further medical
      research.

TI  - Attempts to use breeding approaches in Aedes aegypti to create lines with
      distinct and stable relative Wolbachia densities.
LID - 10.1038/s41437-022-00553-x [doi]
AB  - Wolbachia is an insect endosymbiont being used for biological control in the
      mosquito Aedes aegypti because it causes cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) and
      limits viral replication of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. While the
      genetic mechanism of pathogen blocking (PB) is not fully understood, the strength
      of both CI and PB are positively correlated with Wolbachia densities in the host.
      Wolbachia densities are determined by a combination of Wolbachia strain and
      insect genotype, as well as interactions with the environment. We employed both
      artificial selection and inbreeding with the goal of creating lines of Ae.
      aegypti with heritable and distinct Wolbachia densities so that we might better
      dissect the mechanism underlying PB. We were unable to shift the mean relative
      Wolbachia density in Ae. aegypti lines by either strategy, with relative
      densities instead tending to cycle over a narrow range. In lieu of this, we used 
      Wolbachia densities in mosquito legs as predictors of relative densities in the
      remaining individual's carcass. Because we worked with outbred mosquitoes, our
      findings indicate either a lack of genetic variation in the mosquito for
      controlling relative density, natural selection against extreme densities, or a
      predominance of environmental factors affecting densities. Our study reveals that
      there are moderating forces acting on relative Wolbachia densities that may help 
      to stabilize density phenotypes post field release. We also show a means to
      accurately bin vector carcasses into high and low categories for non-DNA
      omics-based studies of Wolbachia-mediated traits.

      replication.

AB  - Mast cell products and high levels of type 2 cytokines are associated with severe
      dengue disease. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are type-2
      cytokine-producing cells that are activated by epithelial cytokines and mast
      cell-derived lipid mediators. Through ex vivo RNAseq analysis, we observed that
      ILC2 are activated during acute dengue viral infection, and show an impaired type
      I-IFN signature in severe disease. We observed that circulating ILC2 are
      permissive for dengue virus infection in vivo and in vitro, particularly when
      activated through prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). ILC2 underwent productive dengue virus
      infection, which was inhibited through CRTH2 antagonism. Furthermore, exogenous
      IFN-beta induced expression of type I-IFN responsive anti-viral genes by ILC2.
      PGD2 downregulated type I-IFN responsive gene and protein expression; and urinary
      prostaglandin D2 metabolite levels were elevated in severe dengue. Moreover,
      supernatants from activated ILC2 enhanced monocyte infection in a GM-CSF and
      mannan-dependent manner. Our results indicate that dengue virus co-opts an innate
      type 2 environment to escape early type I-IFN control and facilitate viral
      dissemination. PGD2 downregulates type I-IFN induced anti-viral responses in
      ILC2. CRTH2 antagonism may be a therapeutic strategy for dengue-associated
      disease.

TI  - A rapid method for screening mosquito repellents on Anopheles pseudopunctipennis 
      and Aedes aegypti.
LID - 10.1007/s00436-022-07600-w [doi]
AB  - One of the main vectors for malaria in Latin America is Anopheles
      pseudopunctipennis (Theobald), whereas Aedes aegypti (L.) is the primary vector
      of dengue, yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya viruses. The use of repellents is
      recommended as a personal protection method against these mosquitoes. However
      there are very few studies evaluating the effect of repellents on An.
      pseudopunctipennis. The use of a Petri dish to study repellence has been applied 
      by several authors on flies, cockroaches, kissing bugs and mosquitoes, being a
      valuable technique for species that are difficult to breed under laboratory
      conditions, such as An. pseudopunctipennis. In the present study, we evaluated
      the repellence of the essential oil of the Eucalyptus nitens (Shining gum), its
      main component (1,8-cineole) and the commercial repellent DEET on An.
      pseudopunctipennis and Ae. aegypti adult females using the plaque repellency
      method coupled to EthoVision XT10.1 video-tracking software. Repellent effect and
      locomotor activity were studied through a repellence index (RI) together with an 
      axis constructed from the behavioural variables obtained using the tracking
      software. DEET repellent effect was observed at 0.01 mg/mL for Ae. aegypti and
      0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL for An. pseudopunctipennis. In addition, the essential oil
      showed significant repellence at 1 and 10 mg/mL for Ae. aegypti, and 1, 5, 10 and
      25 mg/mL for An. pseudopunctipennis. Neither of these species were repelled at
      any concentration of 1,8-cineole. This is the first study that evaluates these
      compounds on An. pseudopunctipennis females and quantifies their effects on the
      activity of both species.

PG  - 894200
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.894200 [doi]
AB  - Due to the nature of RNA viruses, their high mutation rates produce a population 
      of closely related but genetically diverse viruses, termed quasispecies. To
      determine the role of quasispecies in DENV disease severity, 22 isolates (10 from
      mild cases, 12 from fatal cases) were obtained, amplified, and sequenced with
      Next Generation Sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Using variation
      calling, unique wildtype nucleotide positions were selected and analyzed for
      variant nucleotides between mild and fatal cases. The analysis of variant
      nucleotides between mild and fatal cases showed 6 positions with a significant
      difference of p < 0.05 with 1 position in the structural region, and 5 positions 
      in the non-structural (NS) regions. All variations were found to have a higher
      percentage in fatal cases. To further investigate the genetic changes that affect
      the virus's properties, reverse genetics (rg) viruses containing substitutions
      with the variations were generated and viral growth properties were examined. We 
      found that the virus variant rgNS5-T7812G (G81G) had higher replication rates in 
      both Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) and Vero cells while rgNS5-C9420A (A617A)
      had a higher replication rate only in BHK-21 cells compared to wildtype virus.
      Both variants were considered temperature sensitive whereby the viral titers of
      the variants were relatively lower at 39 degrees C, but was higher at 35 and 37
      degrees C. Additionally, the variants were thermally stable compared to wildtype 
      at temperatures of 29, 37, and 39 degrees C. In conclusion, viral quasispecies
      found in isolates from the 2015 DENV epidemic, resulted in variations with
      significant difference between mild and fatal cases. These variations, NS5-T7812G
      (G81G) and NS5-C9420A (A617A), affect viral properties which may play a role in
      the virulence of DENV.

      Capsid Protein During Infection.
PG  - 889693
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.889693 [doi]
AB  - In the past decade, dengue virus infection is one of the most prevalent and
      rapidly spreading arthropod-borne diseases worldwide with about 400 million
      infections every year. Although it has been reported that the dengue virus could 
      take advantage of autophagy to promote its propagation, the association between
      selective autophagy and the dengue virus remains largely unclear. Here, we
      demonstrated that dengue virus capsid protein, the key viral protein for virus
      assembly, maturation, and replication, underwent autophagic degradation after
      autophagy activation. Autophagy cargo receptor p62 delivered ubiquitinated capsid
      protein to autophagosomes for degradation, which could be enhanced by Torin 1
      treatments. Further study revealed that the association between p62 and viral
      capsid protein was dependent on the ubiquitin-binding domain of p62, and the
      poly-ubiquitin conjugated at lysine 76 of capsid protein served as a recognition 
      signal for autophagy. Consistently, p62 deficiency in Huh7 cells led to the
      enhancement of dengue virus replication. Our study revealed that p62 targeted
      dengue virus capsid protein for autophagic degradation in a ubiquitin-dependent
      manner, which might uncover the potential roles of p62 in restricting dengue
      virus replication.

LID - 10.1002/ccr3.6107 [doi]
AB  - Recently, in Pakistan, several cases of mysterious dengue-like illness are being 
      reported, which has concerned the authorities and requires prompt action. We
      present a case of a 52-year-old female patient presenting with a history of
      continuous fever, documented up to 104 F, for 5 days. The symptoms were
      associated with headache, nausea, retro-orbital headache, arthralgia, and
      myalgia. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case
      in the literature for the endemic mysterious virus and may serve as the
      groundwork for future studies.

TI  - Seropositive Neuromyelitis Optica in a Case of Undiagnosed Ankylosing
      Spondylitis: A Neuro-Rheumatological Conundrum.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.5339/qmj.2022.29 [doi]
AB  - Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune astrocytopathy
      against foot processes of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels. Patients with NMOSD 
      tend to have other coexisting autoimmune/connective tissue diseases. However,
      AQP-4-antibody-positive NMOSD coexisting with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is
      rare. AS is an immune-mediated disorder, a subset of axial spondyloarthropathies,
      which commonly manifests as chronic inflammatory back pain in young people, and
      it has a strong association with HLA-B27. In this study, a 35-year-old Indian man
      with an undiagnosed progressive axial spondyloarthropathy (i.e., AS) is reported 
      presenting with acute-onset longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, a
      clinical subset of NMOSD. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a
      primary demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), is an
      autoimmune astrocytopathy against foot processes of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water
      channels, which manifests with optic neuritis, longitudinally extensive
      transverse myelitis (LETM), area-postrema syndrome, brainstem syndrome
      diencephalic syndrome, and cerebral syndrome.(1-4) Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is
      an immune-mediated disorder, a subset of axial spondyloarthropathies, which
      commonly manifests as chronic inflammatory back pain in young people, and it has 
      a strong association with HLA-B27.(5,6) AS characteristically targets the axial
      skeleton, peripheral joints, entheses (connective tissues between
      tendons/ligaments and bones), and gut.(5,6) Patients with NMOSD tend to have
      other coexisting autoimmune/connective tissue diseases.(7) For example, cases
      with NMOSD and multiple sclerosis, which are other autoimmune primary
      demyelinating disorders of the CNS, have been reported.(8,9) However, concurrent 
      existence of AS and NMOSD in the same patient even over years of disease course
      is rare.(10,11) In addition, studies describing neurological manifestations of AS
      are limited,(12) and they focus on joint inflammation and long-standing bony
      pathology (ankylosis) related to compressive myelopathy, myelo-radiculopathy, and
      cauda equina syndromes.(12,13) The authors present a case of a young Indian man
      with an undiagnosed progressive AS (misdiagnosed and mismanaged by an indigenous 
      medical practitioner) presenting with acute-onset LETM variant of AQP4-positive
      NMOSD. A 35-year-old healthy, non-comorbid man from rural India came to the
      outpatient department with complaints of persistent tingling, numbness, and
      weakness of both lower limbs (right more than left) for 10 days. The clinical
      picture showed acute-onset urinary retention, which was relieved by urinary
      catheterization. An indigenous medical practitioner had prescribed drugs to treat
      a urinary tract infection. His weakness gradually progressed over the following
      week, causing him to become bedridden. During the removal of the catheter, he
      felt urgency, increased frequency of micturition, and overt urinary incontinence.
      He gave no history suggestive of any girdle-like sensations, root/radicular/tract
      pain, vertebral pain, trauma, recent vaccination, and diarrheal or febrile
      illness. For the last 8 months, he had a complaint of an insidious-onset,
      persistent, bilateral, dull aching pain in the gluteal region accompanied by
      low-back pain and morning stiffness up to 1 h, which markedly improved with
      activity and reoccurred following long periods of inactivity. He sometimes had to
      rise in the middle of the night because of excruciating pain, which could be
      relieved after moving around the room and corridors for half an hour. He was
      taking over-the-counter diclofenac tablets for pain relief prescribed by some
      indigenous medical practitioners who told him that it was due to overwork in
      agricultural fields, that is, mechanical back pain. He also had a normal X-ray of
      the lumbosacral spine. He had no addiction liabilities, and none of the family
      members had ever suffered from a similar kind of illness. He had never consulted 
      any trained medical practitioner, as his previous back-pain-related symptoms
      responded well to the tablets prescribed by the indigenous medical
      practitioner(s). During examination, he was found to have recent-onset,
      asymmetric spastic paraparesis (right more than left) with upper motor
      neuron-type urinary bladder symptoms. Cognitive assessment (assessed by the
      Montreal cognitive assessment test) was normal, and posterior column sensations
      were preserved. Sensory system examination revealed no definite sensory level.
      Except for the paretic lower limbs, cerebellar functions were normal in other
      regions. Neuro-ophthalmological examinations were also normal, and no signs of
      meningeal irritation were observed. The history and course of the disease and
      clinical examinations were analyzed. Selective tractopathy (early and predominant
      motor and autonomic tract affection) was suggested for an intramedullary
      demyelinating pathology affecting the anterior central cord. This case was
      initially classified as acute-onset non-compressive myelopathy at the lower
      cervical/upper dorsal region level in a patient with a pre-existing axial
      spondyloarthropathy. Complete blood cell count; liver, kidney, and thyroid
      function tests; and plasma glucose and electrolytes were normal, except for an
      increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (66 mm in the first hour). Magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord revealed a demyelinating LETM from C5 
      to D4 level (Figure 1). Meanwhile, an MRI of the sacroiliac joints revealed
      bilateral sacroiliitis. Brain and orbital MRIs were devoid of any lesions.
      Anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP-4) antibodies were tested by cell-based assay in serum and 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and both were positive. CSF further revealed
      lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased intrathecal protein production. Visually
      evoked potential recordings were also normal. In addition, anti-myelin
      oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies were negative. Anti-nuclear antibody
      (ANA), ANA-profile, autoimmune vasculitis profile (c-ANCA, p-ANCA), neurovirus
      panel (i.e., polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes
      simplex viruses 1 and 2, human herpesviruses 6 and 7, cytomegalovirus,
      enteroviruses, varicella-zoster virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue virus), 
      CSF-polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
      angiotensin-converting enzyme, anti-phospholipid, and anti-thyroid antibodies
      were negative. Anti-CCP-antibody and rheumatoid factor were also negative,
      including creatine phosphokinase level and serum vitamin B12. Moreover,
      serologies for hepatitis B, C, human immunodeficiency virus, and scrub typhus
      were negative. However, HLA-B27 assay was positive. The final diagnosis was
      AQP4-positive NMOSD associated with AS. He was placed on pulse intravenous
      methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 5 days). Consequently, his lower limb power
      improved remarkably. Cyclical rituximab therapy was initiated to prevent
      relapses. At 3-month follow-up, he had no residual neurological deficit except
      for persistence of paresthesias. Neuroimaging and visually evoked potential
      studies revealed no active or new lesions. After 6 months of therapy, a
      subjective and objective improvement was observed in disease severity based on
      the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score. Our patient satisfied the new 
      Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society diagnostic/classification
      criteria for AS and the Wingerchuk criteria for NMOSD,(4,14) an association that 
      has been rarely reported.(10,11) Amid the extra-articular complications of
      long-standing AS, neurological manifestations are considered infrequent.(15)
      However, subclinical neurological complications may be frequent in AS.(12) Common
      neurological manifestations result from bony (vertebral) ankylosis, subluxation
      of joints, ossification of anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments,
      secondary spinal canal stenosis, bony (vertebral) fractures, and subsequent
      compressions over nerve radicles/roots/cauda equina, and inflammation-related
      (entrapment) peripheral neuropathies.(12,16,17) Acute transverse myelitis can
      occur as a subset of several primary demyelinating disorders of the CNS (i.e.,
      multiple sclerosis, NMOSD, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease, 
      and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) and various systemic autoimmune
      connective tissue disorders (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective
      tissue disease, Sjogren syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and
      neurosarcoidosis).(18) Acute transverse myelitis (short or long segment) is an
      infrequent extra-articular complication of AS.(18) It has been reported to evolve
      either as a distinct neurological complication of AS, or it may develop secondary
      to TNF-alpha-inhibitor therapy for the treatment of AS.(18,19) AS is a heritable 
      inflammatory spondyloarthropathy that primarily affects the axial skeleton, which
      is mediated by T-cells; B-cells only play a minor role.(5) On the contrary, the
      key for the pathogenesis of NMOSD is the production of autoantibodies against
      AQP-4 channels expressed on astrocytes, leading to complement-mediated damage,
      with ensuing demyelination. Myelitis usually shows high signal intensity on the
      tbl2-weighted image and contrast enhancement in the spinal cord.(1-4) Despite the
      difference in molecular mechanisms, the diagnosis of these diseases in the same
      individual may not be coincidental. Recent evidence has shown T-cell-mediated
      inflammatory responses in cases of NMOSD.(20) In particular, Th17 and Th2-related
      cytokines are elevated in the CSF of NMO patients.(20) Environmental factors such
      as Escherichia coli have also been proven to aggravate autoimmunity in AS and
      NMOSD (however, body fluid cultures for Escherichia coli, performed in our
      patient, showed similar association, and they were found negative two
      times).(21,22) Although large-scale epidemiological studies investigating the
      underlying pathogenesis related to these diseases are lacking, studies have
      demonstrated an increased incidence of optic neuritis among patients with AS.(23)
      Systemic sclerosis and mixed and undifferentiated connective tissue diseases were
      excluded after expert opinions (from two board-certified rheumatologists and two 
      dermatologists) because of the lack of suggestive clinical findings (e.g.,
      absence of skin thickening, salt-and-pepper appearance, nail changes, Mauskopf
      facies, sclerodactyly, calcinosis cutis, Raynaud's phenomenon, other cutaneous
      manifestations, pulmonary arterial hypertension/interstitial lung disease,
      dysphagia, muscular pain/weakness renal impairments, absence of ANA,
      anti-centromere antibodies, anti-Scl-70, PM-Scl antibodies, anti-ds DNA, PCNA,
      CENP-B, anti-nucleosomes, anti-Smith, anti-U1-RNP, anti-Jo1, anti-Mi2, anti-Ro52,
      anti-La antibodies, and normal C3 and C4 complement levels) (The European League 
      Against Rheumatism and the American College of Rheumatology classification
      criteria 2019).(24) Finally, our patient was treated with intravenous steroids
      followed by rituximab infusions, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody directed against
      B-cells. In particular, this patient clinically and radiologically responded to
      immunomodulatory drugs, which might support a possible common pathogenic basis of
      the two processes. TNF-alpha inhibitors are commonly used as novel therapeutics
      in AS; however, they can potentially result in serious complications, that is,
      secondary demyelinating disorders.(25) However, such inhibitors in this patient
      were not used. When used in cases of AS, they show satisfactory results.(25,26)
      Therefore, it was decided to treat him with rituximab only without adding any
      second immunomodulatory. Other possible therapeutic options include
      cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, but they were not used because of
      their low efficacy-safety balance. Moreover, plasmapheresis was not available in 
      our specific setting, despite solid evidence that early treatment with
      therapeutic strategy (5-7 courses) provides good long-term outcomes in patients
      with NMOSD.(27) Therefore, when dealing with a case of acute non-compressive
      myelopathy, history and clinical examination are important to determine the
      potential underlying etiology and identify an undermined systemic disorder with
      apparently unrelated non-specific features. Connective tissue disorders should
      always be considered as a differential diagnosis and be ruled out in all cases of
      either seropositive or seronegative NMOSD. A diagnosis of AS should be considered
      in relevant circumstances when dealing with a case of isolated seronegative LETM.
      Moreover, early diagnosis and treatment of AS are quintessential to prevent
      lifelong distressing disabilities. However, whether patients with AS have any
      extra predilection to develop NMOSD throughout their life requires further
      studies.

AB  - Dengue is a common viral infection worldwide, though its neurological
      manifestations are infrequent (2%-11% in recent years) and can be varied as the
      Dengue virus per se is a non-neurotropic virus. Neurological manifestations of
      Dengue usually result from multisystem dysfunction which may be secondary to
      vascular leak or it can be due to direct virus invasion (dengue encephalitis) or 
      an immunological phenomenon which is triggered by dengue infection (demyelinating
      disorders). Here we present two cases of dengue fever associated demyelinating
      disorders in two pediatric patients aptly depicting the two spectra of the
      disease. One of them is a case of fatal acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy
      (AHLE) in a 3-year-old girl, that developed severe neurological sequelae while
      the other one is a case of an Acute disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in a
      3-year-old boy who had recovered with timely immunomodulatory therapy and
      appropriate management.

TI  - The association between diabetes and obesity with Dengue infections.
PG  - 101
LID - 10.1186/s13098-022-00870-5 [doi]
AB  - Dengue, an arboviral disease is a global threat to public health as the number of
      Dengue cases increases through the decades and this trend is predicted to
      continue. Non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and obesity are also on an
      upward trend. Moreover, past clinical studies have shown comorbidities worsen the
      clinical manifestation of especially Severe Dengue. However, discussion regarding
      the underlying mechanisms regarding the association between these comorbidities
      and dengue are lacking. The hallmark of Severe Dengue is plasma leakage which is 
      due to several factors including presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
      dysregulation of endothelial barrier protein expression. The key factors of
      diabetes affecting endothelial functions are Th1 skewed responses and
      junctional-related proteins expression. Additionally, obesity alters the lipid
      metabolism and immune response causing increased viral replication and
      inflammation. The similarity between diabetes and obesity individuals is in
      having chronic inflammation resulting in endothelial dysfunction. This review
      outlines the roles of diabetes and obesity in severe dengue and gives some
      insights into the plausible mechanisms of comorbidities in Severe Dengue.

TI  - Persistence of immunity against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 following homologous and
      heterologous COVID-19 booster vaccines in healthy adults after a two-doses
      AZD1222 vaccination.
LID - S1201-9712(22)00433-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijid.2022.07.038 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant presents numerous mutations
      potentially able to evade neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) elicited by COVID-19
      vaccines. Therefore, this study aimed to provide evidence on a heterologous
      booster strategy to overcome the waning immunity against Omicron variants.
      METHODS: Participants who completed Oxford/AstraZeneca (hereafter AZD1222) for
      5-7 months were enrolled. The reactogenicity and persistence of immunogenicity in
      both humoral and cellular response after a homologous or heterologous booster
      with the AZD1222 and mRNA vaccines (BNT162B2, full or half-dose mRNA-1273)
      administered six months after primary vaccination were determined. RESULTS: A
      total of 229 individuals enrolled, a waning of immunity was observed 5-7 months
      after the AZD1222-primed. Total RBD immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, anti-RBD IgG and 
      focus reduction neutralization test against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 and T-cell
      response peaked at 14-28 days after booster vaccination. Both the full and half
      dose of mRNA-1273 induced the highest response, followed by BNT162b2 and AZD1222.
      At 90 days, the persistence of immunogenicity was observed among all mRNA-boosted
      individuals. Adverse events were acceptable for all vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: A
      heterologous mRNA booster provided a significantly superior boost of binding and 
      NAbs levels against the Omicron variant compared to a homologous booster in
      individuals with AZD1222-primed vaccinations.

AB  - The RNA viruses SARS-CoV-2 and dengue pose a major threat to human health
      worldwide and their proteases (M(pro); NS2B/NS3) are considered as promising
      targets for drug development. We present the synthesis and biological evaluation 
      of novel benzoxaborole inhibitors of these two proteases. The most active
      compound achieves single-digit micromolar activity against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) in a
      biochemical assay. The most active substance against dengue NS2B/NS3 protease has
      submicromolar activity in cells (EC50 0.54 muM) and inhibits DENV-2 replication
      in cell culture. Most benzoxaboroles had no relevant cytotoxicity or significant 
      off-target inhibition. Furthermore, the class demonstrated passive membrane
      penetration and stability against the evaluated proteases. This compound class
      may contribute to the development of antiviral agents with activity against DENV 
      or SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Zika Virus Replication in a Mast Cell Model is Augmented by Dengue Virus
      Antibody-Dependent Enhancement and Features a Selective Immune Mediator Secretory
      Profile.
PG  - e0177222
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01772-22 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus and dengue virus are evolutionarily related and structurally similar
      mosquito-borne Flaviviruses. These congruencies can lead to cross-reactive
      antibody binding, whereby antibodies generated from previous dengue virus
      immunity can augment Zika virus replication in vitro. This phenomenon, termed
      antibody-dependent enhancement, may participate in the clinical manifestations
      detected in areas with Flavivirus cocirculations where Zika virus is endemic;
      however, a causal relationship has yet to be determined. The KU812 mast
      cell/basophil line was integral in identifying the first Flavivirus infection in 
      mast cells and serves as an effective in vitro model to study dengue virus
      antibody-dependent enhancement. Mast cells, sentinel white blood cells intrinsic 
      in coordinating early immune defenses, are characteristically situated in the
      intradermal space and are therefore among the first immune cells interfaced with 
      blood-feeding mosquitoes. Here, we tested whether KU812 cells were permissive to 
      Zika virus, how previous dengue virus immunity might augment Zika virus
      infection, and whether either condition induces an immunological response. We
      report an antibody-dependent enhancement effect of Zika virus infection in KU812 
      cells across multiple time points (48, 72, and 96 hours postinfection [hpi]) and 
      a range of multiplicities of infection (4.0 x 10(-3) to 4) using various
      concentrations of cross-reactive dengue virus monoclonal antibodies (D11C and
      1.6D). This antigen-specific antibody-mediated infection was selectively coupled 
      to chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), and C-X-C motif
      chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) secretion and a reduction in granzyme B (GrB)
      release. Therefore, mast cells and/or basophils may significantly augment Zika
      virus infection in the context of preexisting dengue virus immunity. IMPORTANCE
      Antibodies generated against one dengue serotype can enhance infection of another
      by a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Additionally,
      antigenic similarities between Zika and dengue viruses can promote Zika virus
      infection by way of ADE in vitro using these very same anti-dengue antibodies. We
      used the KU812 cell line to demonstrate for the first time that anti-dengue
      antibodies enhanced infectious Zika virus replication in a mast cell model and
      specifically increased CCL5, CXCL10, and IL-1beta, while also impairing granzyme 
      B secretion. Furthermore, enhanced Zika virus infection and selective mediator
      release were mechanistically dependent on fragment crystallizable gamma receptor 
      II (FcgammaRII). These findings establish a new model for Zika virus research and
      a new subcategory of immune cells previously unexplored in the context of Zika
      virus enhancement while being some of the very first immune cells likely to meet 
      a blood-feeding infected mosquito.

TI  - S-Palmitoylation and Sterol Interactions Mediate Antiviral Specificity of IFITMs.
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.2c00176 [doi]
AB  - Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM1, 2, and 3) are important
      antiviral proteins that are active against many viruses, including influenza A
      virus (IAV), dengue virus (DENV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). IFITM proteins exhibit 
      specificity in activity, but their distinct mechanisms of action and regulation
      are unclear. Since S-palmitoylation and cholesterol homeostasis are crucial for
      viral infections, we investigated IFITM interactions with cholesterol by
      photoaffinity cross-linking in mammalian cells along with molecular dynamic
      simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis in vitro. These studies
      suggest that cholesterol can directly interact with S-palmitoylated IFITMs in
      cells and alter the conformation of IFITMs in membrane bilayers. Notably, we
      discovered that the S-palmitoylation levels regulate differential IFITM protein
      interactions with cholesterol in mammalian cells and specificity of antiviral
      activity toward IAV, SARS-CoV-2, and EBOV. Our studies suggest that modulation of
      IFITM S-palmitoylation levels and cholesterol interaction influence host
      susceptibility to different viruses.

AB  - Background: Dengue infection has been a worrisome cause of mortality and
      morbidity in children. Though numerous scoring systems have been developed, they 
      are in the adult population or are too complicated for use in children. Pediatric
      dengue infection has a wide spectrum from a mild illness to severe complications 
      and an unpredictable course. Hence the need for a predictive scoring system where
      the possibility of complications can be identified which can contribute to
      reduction in mortality and morbidity of dengue by prompt referrals and
      anticipatory management. Methods: Prospective case cohort study of children with 
      confirmed dengue fever. Results: 303 children were included and divided into two 
      groups - the dengue fever group and the complicated dengue group based on the WHO
      clinical classification. The clinical and laboratory parameters were analysed
      individually, cut offs identified by ROC curves and compared for significance
      between the two groups. The parameters that emerged were hypotension, PCV >/=
      42%, platelet count </= 75000 cells/cumm, WBC >/= 7000 cells/cumm, and ALT >/=
      70U/L. Using the adjusted odd's Ratio, and coefficient, individual predictive
      scores were tabulated ranging from 0 to 3, with a total score of 0 to 7. A
      cut-off score of 2 was then identified based upon the sensitivity (84.13%) and
      specificity (72.50%) as the ideal score to predict complicated dengue. Internal
      validation of the score was done where the area under the curve for predicting
      complicated dengue was 0.86 (95% CI 0.8-0.92) with a P value of <0.001.
      Conclusion: Our dengue predictive scoring system has been developed using five
      indicators, with a score of two and above, out of seven, suggesting increased
      risk of developing complications. This has been validated internally and can be
      used to predict complicated dengue among children.

      in children with dengue shock syndrome: A retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 103890
LID - 10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103890 [doi]
AB  - Background: The mortality of dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in children is still
      high at 12-44%. Assessment of DIC initial score using the International Society
      on Thrombosis and Haemostasis scoring system can help diagnosing and treating
      DIC, while also predicting mortality in pediatric patients with DSS. Methods: We 
      retrospectively collected data of children with DSS at Dr. Sardjito Hospital
      between January 2017 and June 2021 with inclusion criteria such as age 1 month to
      18 years and laboratory parameters taken within first 24 h after DSS workup.
      Results: Results showed a sample population consisting of 20 male subjects
      (58.8%), 24 aged >5 years (76.0%), 21 with good nutritional status (61.8%), and
      median length of stay 5 days (3-7), with saturation of 98% (97-99) and median
      pediatric Glasgow coma scale level of consciousness of 13. The laboratory profile
      showed median levels of hematocrit at 40.9% (32.9-44.9), thrombocytes at 20,500/L
      (14,000-32,000), prothrombin time of 17.8 s (14.9-25.3), fibrinogen at 123 mg/dL 
      (106-184) and D-dimer at 832.5 ng/mL (362-1119). A DIC initial score of >/=5 25
      (73.5%) resulted with a mortality of 9 children (36.0%) with a 92% survival rate 
      in the first 6 h. The first 6-h survival according to each DIC score parameter
      showed 93.8%, 100%, 85.7%, and 94.1% of thrombocytes </=50,000 mu/L, fibrinogen
      <100 mg/dL, D-dimer >1000 ng/mL, and prothrombin time >6 s, respectively.
      Conclusion: A DIC initial score >/=5 can be used as a mortality predictor in the 
      first 6 h after DSS diagnosis.

AB  - Dengue fever is a severe disease spread by Aedes mosquito-borne dengue viruses
      (DENVs) in tropical areas such as Bangladesh. Since its breakout in the 1960s,
      dengue fever has been endemic in Bangladesh, with the highest concentration of
      infections in the capital, Dhaka. This study aims to develop a machine learning
      model that can use relevant information about the factors that cause Dengue
      outbreaks within a geographic region. To predict dengue cases in 11 different
      districts of Bangladesh, we created a DengueBD dataset and employed two machine
      learning algorithms, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Support Vector
      Regression (SVR). This research also explores the correlation among environmental
      factors like temperature, rainfall, and humidity with the rise and decline trend 
      of Dengue cases in different cities of Bangladesh. The entire dataset was divided
      into an 80:20 ratio, with 80 percent used for training and 20% used for testing. 
      The research findings imply that, for both the MLR with 67% accuracy along with
      Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.57 and SVR models with 75% accuracy along with
      Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.95, the number of dengue cases reduces throughout 
      the winter season in the country and increases mainly during the rainy season in 
      the next ten months, from August 2021 to May 2022. Importantly, Dhaka,
      Bangladesh's capital, will see the maximum number of dengue patients during this 
      period. Overall, the results of this data-driven analysis show that machine
      learning algorithms have enormous potential for predicting dengue epidemics.

TI  - The microbial RNA metagenome of Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) from
      Germany.
LID - 10.1007/s00436-022-07576-7 [doi]
AB  - Aedes albopictus is a highly invasive mosquito species that has become widespread
      across the globe. In addition, it is an efficient vector of numerous pathogens of
      medical and veterinary importance, including dengue, chikungunya and Zika
      viruses. Among others, the vector potential of mosquitoes is influenced by their 
      microbiome. However, this influence is very dynamic and can vary between
      individuals and life stages. To obtain a rough overview on the microbiome of Ae. 
      albopictus populations in Germany, pooled female and pooled male individuals from
      seven German locations were investigated by total RNA sequencing. The mosquito
      specimens had been collected as larvae in the field and processed immediately
      after adult emergence, i.e. without females having fed on blood. RNA fragments
      with high degrees of identity to a large number of viruses and microorganisms
      were identified, including, for example, Wolbachia pipientis and Acinetobacter
      baumannii, with differences between male and female mosquitoes. Knowledge about
      the natural occurrence of microorganisms in mosquitoes may be translated into new
      approaches to vector control, for example W. pipientis can be exploited to
      manipulate mosquito reproduction and vector competence. The study results show
      how diverse the microbiome of Ae. albopictus can be, and the more so needs to be 
      adequately analysed and interpreted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus has continued to spread throughout the world where 
      there are other endemic diseases that have been a burden to public health for
      many years. As any infection, it was expected there could be coinfection between 
      these. Tropical and subtropical countries are currently managing with dengue as
      peaks increase with shorter periods of time. AIM: To summarize the evidence that 
      exists in the co-infection related to SARS-CoV-2 and the dengue virus. METHOD: We
      conducted a narrative review in data bases about reports of coinfection and
      misdiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and dengue virus given the fact that rainy season
      every year increase the prevalence of viral infections in endemic countries.
      Recent reports have even described positive cases in one of these infections that
      later resulted in false positive. A positive test for COVID-19 or dengue fever in
      endemic areas should not exclude the other infection. CONCLUSION: From now on,
      these two should be considered as a differential diagnosis and this should raise 
      public health concern for COVID-19 and dengue coinfection in endemic countries to
      reinforce promotion and prevention to communities to prevent these diseases.

AB  - Objective: To analyze epidemic situation of dengue fever in 2019 and the
      incidence trends from 2013 to 2019 in the Belt and Road countries. Methods: We
      used age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) which was from Global Burden of
      Disease Study 2019 to describe the epidemic situation of dengue fever in 2019.
      The estimated annual percentage change(EAPC) of the ASR was calculated to assess 
      dengue fever incidence trends from 2013 to 2019. Results: The 2019 GBD dengue
      fever incidence records showed that in 145 Belt and Road countries, 93 (64.14%)
      countries had dengue fever epidemics. In 2019, there were 11 countries with the
      incidence >3 000.00 per 100 000, including 9 countries in Oceania; 16 countries
      with the incidence of 1 000.00 per 100 000-2 999.99 per 100 000, including 10
      countries in Asia. The incidence rates in most countries in Africa
      (58.14%,25/43), North America (72.73%,8/11) and South America (66.67%,4/6) ranged
      from 500.00 per 100 000 to 999.99 per 100 000. The incidence rates of dengue
      fever in 90.00% (9/10) of countries in Oceania showed increasing trend, and the
      increasing trend in Fiji was most obvious (EAPC=18.22,95%CI:12.91-23.77), and the
      incidence rates of dengue fever in 18.18% (4/22) of countries in Asia showed
      increasing trend, the increasing trend in the Philippines was most obvious
      (EAPC=3.09,95%CI:1.74-4.45), and the incidence rates of dengue fever in 4.65%
      (2/43) of countries in Africa showed increasing trend, and the increasing trend
      in Seychelles was most obvious (EAPC=18.20,95%CI:7.82-29.58). The incidence rates
      of dengue fever showed no increasing trend in countries in South America and
      North America. Conclusions: In 2019, more than 60% of the Belt and Road countries
      had dengue fever epidemics. The incidences of dengue fever were high and showed
      increasing trends in most Oceanian countries, but the dengue fever epidemics in
      the countries in Asia, Africa and Americas were relatively mild.

AB  - Since the proposing the initiative of jointly building Belt and Road by China in 
      2013, as of December 9, 2021, 145 countries had signed cooperation agreements,
      covering six continents around the world. Differences in economic development
      level and natural conditions might lead to different epidemics of infectious
      diseases and spread risks. The articles in this issue briefly describe the
      epidemic situation and prevention and control challenges of four infectious
      diseases globally, including HIV/AIDS, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, dengue
      fever and malaria, and report the epidemic situation and trends of the above
      mentioned four diseases in the Belt and Road countries to provide epidemiological
      evidence for the Belt and Road initiative and the development of public health
      security policy.

PG  - 333-338
LID - 10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Background: All four dengue serotypes cause infection, with one of them
      predominantly reported from a particular geographical region. Coinfection by more
      than one serotype is reported from hyperendemic regions. These coinfections are
      clinically more severe than infection with a single serotype. This study was
      carried out to detect the predominant dengue serotype and presence of
      coinfections. Methods: Acute-phase serum samples of patients suffering from
      dengue infection were collected. They were screened for the presence of IgM, IgG 
      and NS1Ag by a rapid test. Conventional multiplex reverse transcriptase
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays were
      carried out for detection and serotyping of the dengue virus. Results: A total of
      196 samples were positive by the rapid card test. Of these, 139 were NS1Ag
      positive, 40 were positive only for IgM, 5 were positive only for IgG and 12
      samples were positive for different combinations of antigen and antibodies. All
      four serotypes were detected in these samples by PCR. DENV-3 was found to be most
      common circulating serotype. A total of 22 cases were found to have coinfection
      with more than one dengue serotypes. Samples having only antibodies and no
      antigen on rapid card test were also positive for virus by PCR. Conclusion:
      Prevalence of dengue co-infections is increasing. Moreover, it is important to
      screen for dengue virus in those samples also which do not show NS1Ag on rapid
      tests and have either one or both the antibodies. Real-time multiplex RT-PCR is
      found to be more sensitive in detecting coinfection than conventional multiplex
      RT-PCR.

      and review of the literature.

LID - 10.25259/SNI_334_2022 [doi]
AB  - Background: Central nervous system (CNS) complications of dengue fever, a
      mosquito-borne single standard RNA virus illness, are reported in <1% of all
      cases. Hemorrhagic complications in severe forms of the disease can be
      life-threatening. The literature on cases, where hemorrhagic CNS complications
      necessitated neurosurgical intervention, is exceedingly sparse. The authors
      report their experience of a patient who developed an isolated acute subdural
      hematoma (SDH) due to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in the critical period of
      the illness with a poor prognosis. Despite a moribund patient, the SDH was
      immediately evacuated, achieving a good outcome. Case Description: A 65-year-old 
      male patient was admitted with high-grade febrile illness and diagnosed with
      dengue. The patient had no focal neurology and was managed adequately following
      the primary survey on admission but, then, developed severe thrombocytopenia and 
      eventually the critical phase of dengue illness. On the 5(th) admission day, the 
      patient collapsed. Glasgow Coma Score was 3/15 with bilaterally dilated, fixed
      pupils. Immediate computed tomography head revealed a large left SDH with a
      significant midline shift. SDH was emergently evacuated with two units of
      platelets transfused peroperatively and two additional units postoperatively.
      Thrombocytopenia resolved within 48 h, and interval scanning showed gradual
      resolution of SDH. The patient was discharged 18 days later. Five months later,
      on follow-up, the patient is well with mild left-sided weakness and an Extended
      Glasgow Outcome Score of 7. Conclusion: Isolated SDH is a rare but
      life-threatening hemorrhagic complication of DHF. Even in the critical phase of
      illness, with severe thrombocytopenia, surgical evacuation should be considered
      if the SDH is present in isolation, within an accessible area, and can be
      operated on immediately.

PG  - 748-753
AB  - Objective To prepare neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against envelope
      protein domain III of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-EDIII) and identify
      its specificity. Methods BALB/c mice were immunized with recombinant EDIII
      protein (rDENV-EDIII) of the four DENV serotypes. Hybridoma cells secreting
      DENV-EDIII antibodies were screened by indirect ELISA. The specificity of
      positive hybridoma cells were further tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay
      (IFA). The neutralizing activities of DENV-EDIII mAbs in vitro were determined by
      the enzyme-linked immunospot microneutralization test (ELISPOT-MNT). Results 6
      mAbs specific for the EDIII of the four DENV serotypes and 11 mAbs specific for
      only one serotype of DENV-EDIII protein were obtained, of which one monoclonal
      antibody had a balanced strong neutralizing activity against the four DENV
      serotypes in vitro, and its 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the four
      DENV serotypes was 0.05 mug/mL, 1.89 mug/mL, 0.02 mug/mL, 3.91 mug/mL,
      respectively. Conclusion A specific monoclonal antibody against DENV-EDIII is
      successfully screened and obtained to neutralize the four DENV serotypes.

TI  - Infectious disease surveillance system in Pakistan: challenges and way forward.
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1186/s41182-022-00439-y [doi]
AB  - Infectious Disease Surveillance (IDS) in the community is essential to prevent,
      control, and detect outbreaks. A strong surveillance system is a need of time for
      low to middle-income countries like Pakistan where around half of the reported
      deaths are due to infections that can be easily prevented in the presence of a
      surveillance system. Although Pakistan has IDS which monitors and collects the
      data on several infectious diseases, the system is unreliable, inadequate, and
      substandard. As a result, dengue, tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis B and C, and
      many other infectious diseases are still prevalent in Pakistan and unfortunately,
      the numbers are still rising. In this commentary, we have tried to highlight the 
      problems the country is facing to establish a proper and self-sustainable
      surveillance system and have recommended some steps the relevant stakeholders
      should consider taking to make healthcare better in Pakistan.

AB  - Objective The present study is an in-silicomodel of platelet amplification
      potential of Adhatoda vasica which can be used to treat thrombocytopenia in
      Dengue complications. Methods Docking studies are proved to be an essential tool 
      that facilitates the structural diversity of natural products to be harnessed in 
      an organized manner. In the present study, vasicine containing natural
      anti-dengue potential was subjected to docking studies using Schrodinger glides
      software (ver.11.1). The docking study was carried out to find out the potential 
      molecular targets for selected protein. The docking was carried out on different 
      ligands like vasicine, ramatroban, Chloroquine, Celgosivir and standard
      elthrombopag downloaded from the PubChem and retrieved to glide software and
      ligands prepared using lig prep wizard. Docking was performed using the ligand
      docking wizard of Glide-maestro 2018. Results The docking score of vasicine
      (-5.27) is nearly identical to the standard used elthrombopag (-6.08) and both
      ligands bind with one hydrogen bond. The validation ramatroban score is -12.39
      and bind with five hydrogen bonds, Celgosivir had a docking score of -7.3 with
      three hydrogen bonds, and Chloroquine has no hydrogen bond but a docking score of
      -4.6. Conclusion Vasicine was found to be the most suitable target of platelet
      amplification potential from Adhatoda vasica. However, the molecular docking
      results are preliminary and it indicated that vasicine could be one of the
      potential ligands to treat the thrombocytopenia of dengue and experimental
      evaluation will be carried out in near future.

      inhibiting the expression of inflammatory-liked miRNAs.
PG  - 1-14
LID - 10.1080/20477724.2022.2101840 [doi]
AB  - Dengue disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common
      vector-borne viral disease worldwide. Currently, no treatment is available to
      fight dengue symptoms. We and others have demonstrated the antiviral and
      immunomodulatory properties of VitD3 as a possible therapy for DENV infection.
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs responsible for the regulation of
      cell processes including antiviral defense. Previous transcriptomic analysis
      showed that VitD3 regulates the expression of genes involved in stress and immune
      response by inducing specific miRNAs. Here, we focus on the effects of VitD3
      supplementation in the regulation of the expression of inflammatory-liked
      miR-182-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR125b-5p, miR146a-5p, and miR-155-5p during DENV-2
      infection of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Further, we evaluated the
      effects of inhibition of these miRNAs in the innate immune response. Our results 
      showed that supplementation with VitD3 differentially regulated the expression of
      these inflammatory miRNAs. We also observed that inhibition of miR-182-5p,
      miR-130a-3p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-155-5p, led to decreased production of
      TNF-alpha and TLR9 expression, while increased the expression of SOCS-1,
      IFN-beta, and OAS1, without affecting DENV replication. By contrast,
      over-expression of miR-182-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-155-5p
      significantly decreased DENV-2 infection rates and also DENV-2 replication in
      MDMs. Our results suggest that VitD3 immunomodulatory effects involve regulation 
      of inflammation-linked miRNAs expression, which might play a key role in the
      inflammatory response during DENV infection.

TI  - A controlled effects approach to assessing immune correlates of protection.
LID - kxac024 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/biostatistics/kxac24 [doi]
AB  - An immune correlate of risk (CoR) is an immunologic biomarker in vaccine
      recipients associated with an infectious disease clinical endpoint. An immune
      correlate of protection (CoP) is a CoR that can be used to reliably predict
      vaccine efficacy (VE) against the clinical endpoint and hence is accepted as a
      surrogate endpoint that can be used for accelerated approval or guide use of
      vaccines. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, CoR analysis is limited by
      not assessing a causal vaccine effect. To address this limitation, we construct
      the controlled risk curve of a biomarker, which provides the causal risk of an
      endpoint if all participants are assigned vaccine and the biomarker is set to
      different levels. Furthermore, we propose a causal CoP analysis based on
      controlled effects, where for the important special case that the biomarker is
      constant in the placebo arm, we study the controlled vaccine efficacy curve that 
      contrasts the controlled risk curve with placebo arm risk. We provide
      identification conditions and formulae that account for right censoring of the
      clinical endpoint and two-phase sampling of the biomarker, and consider
      G-computation estimation and inference under a semiparametric model such as the
      Cox model. We add modular approaches to sensitivity analysis that quantify
      robustness of CoP evidence to unmeasured confounding. We provide an application
      to two phase 3 trials of a dengue vaccine indicating that controlled risk of
      dengue strongly varies with 50$\%$ neutralizing antibody titer. Our work
      introduces controlled effects causal mediation analysis to immune CoP evaluation.

PG  - 1662-1670
LID - 10.1016/j.apsb.2021.10.017 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) causes significant human diseases without specific therapy.
      Previously we found erythrosin B, an FDA-approved food additive, inhibited viral 
      NS2B-NS3 interactions, leading to inhibition of ZIKV infection in cell culture.
      In this study, we performed pharmacokinetic and in vivo studies to demonstrate
      the efficacy of erythrosin B against ZIKV in 3D mini-brain organoid and mouse
      models. Our results showed that erythrosin B is very effective in abolishing ZIKV
      replication in the 3D organoid model. Although pharmacokinetics studies indicated
      that erythrosin B had a low absorption profile, mice challenged by a lethal dose 
      of ZIKV showed a significantly improved survival rate upon oral administration of
      erythrosin B, compared to vehicle control. Limited structure-activity
      relationship studies indicated that most analogs of erythrosin B with
      modifications on the xanthene ring led to loss or reduction of inhibitory
      activities towards viral NS2B-NS3 interactions, protease activity and antiviral
      efficacy. In contrast, introducing chlorine substitutions on the isobenzofuran
      ring led to slightly increased activities, suggesting that the isobenzofuran ring
      is well tolerated for modifications. Cytotoxicity studies indicated that all
      derivatives are nontoxic to human cells. Overall, our studies demonstrated
      erythrosin B is an effective antiviral against ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases are still threats to public health in the Zhejiang
      province of China. Surveillance of mosquitoes and the mosquito-borne pathogen is 
      a vital approach for early warning, prevention, and control of the infectious
      disease. In this study, from 2018 to 2020, a total of 141607 female mosquitoes
      were caught by means of the light trap method. The main species were Culex
      pipiens quinquefasciatus/pallens (41.32%), Culex tritaeniorhynchus (47.6%), Aedes
      albopictus (2.5%), Anopheles sinensis (5.87%), Armigeres subalbatus (2.64%) and
      other mosquito species (0.07%). Cx. pipiens s.l. were the dominant species in two
      urban habitats and rural residential areas while Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was the
      main dominant species in the rural livestock sheds. In terms of seasonal
      fluctuation, Cx. pipiens s.l fluctuated at a high level from May to October. The 
      peaks of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, An. sinensis and Ar. subalbatus were in July. In 
      addition, a total of 693 Ae. albopictus were collected with Biogents Mosquitaire 
      CO2 traps in emergency surveillance of dengue fever (DF) and screened for dengue 
      virus infection. There were three circumstances of collection: The first: the
      sampling time before mosquito control during the local outbreak of DF in Lucheng 
      of Wenzhou, 2019; The second circumstance: the sampling time after mosquito
      control during the local outbreak of DF of other cities in 2018-2019; The third
      circumstance: past DF epidemic areas the sampling time before mosquito control
      during the local outbreak of DF in Lucheng, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 2019. The pools
      formed by mosquitoes collected in these three circumstances were 3 (6.1%), 35
      (71.5%), and 11 (22.4%) respectively. Of the 49 pools tested, only one in the
      first circumstance was positive. The full-length dengue virus sequence of
      ZJWZ/2019 was obtained by sequencing and uploaded to the NCBI as number OK448162.
      Full-length nucleotide and amino acid homology analyses showed that ZJWZ2019 and 
      Wenzhou DF serum isolates ZJWZ-62/2019 (MW582816) and ZJWZ-18/2019 (MW582815) had
      the highest homology. The analysis of full genome and E gene phylogenetic trees
      showed that ZJWZ2019 belonged to serotype 1, genotype I, lineage II, which was
      evolutionarily related to OK159963/Cambodia/2019. It implies that ZJWZ2019
      originated in Cambodia. This study showed the species composition, seasonal
      dynamics of mosquitoes in different habitats in Zhejiang province and confirmed
      the role of Ae. albopictus in the transmission cycle of in outbreak of DF in the 
      Lucheng district of Wenzhou in 2019, suggesting the importance of monitoring of
      vector Aedes infected dengue virus in the prevention and control of DF.

LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2022.112427 [doi]
AB  - A new non-integer order mathematical model for SARS-CoV-2, Dengue and HIV
      co-dynamics is designed and studied. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the
      dynamics of dengue and HIV is analyzed using the tools of fractional calculus.
      The existence and uniqueness of solution of the proposed model are established
      employing well known Banach contraction principle. The Ulam-Hyers and generalized
      Ulam-Hyers stability of the model is also presented. We have applied the Laplace 
      Adomian decomposition method to investigate the model with the help of three
      different fractional derivatives, namely: Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio and
      Atangana-Baleanu derivatives. Stability analyses of the iterative schemes are
      also performed. The model fitting using the three fractional derivatives was
      carried out using real data from Argentina. Simulations were performed with each 
      non-integer derivative and the results thus obtained are compared. Furthermore,
      it was concluded that efforts to keep the spread of SARS-CoV-2 low will have a
      significant impact in reducing the co-infections of SARS-CoV-2 and dengue or
      SARS-COV-2 and HIV. We also highlighted the impact of three different fractional 
      derivatives in analyzing complex models dealing with the co-dynamics of different
      diseases.

PG  - 929895
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.929895 [doi]
AB  - The presence of fucose on IgG1 Asn-297 N-linked glycan is the modification of the
      human IgG1 Fc structure with the most significant impact on FcRIII affinity. It
      also significantly enhances the efficacy of antibody dependent cellular
      cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer (NK) cells in vitro, induced by IgG1
      therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The effect of afucosylation on ADCC or 
      antibody dependent phagocytosis (ADCP) mediated by macrophages or
      polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) is less clear. Evidence for enhanced efficacy
      of afucosylated therapeutic mAbs in vivo has also been reported. This has led to 
      the development of several therapeutic antibodies with low Fc core fucose to
      treat cancer and inflammatory diseases, seven of which have already been approved
      for clinical use. More recently, the regulation of IgG Fc core fucosylation has
      been shown to take place naturally during the B-cell immune response: A decrease 
      in alpha-1,6 fucose has been observed in polyclonal, antigen-specific IgG1
      antibodies which are generated during alloimmunization of pregnant women by fetal
      erythrocyte or platelet antigens and following infection by some enveloped
      viruses and parasites. Low IgG1 Fc core fucose on antigen-specific polyclonal
      IgG1 has been linked to disease severity in several cases, such as SARS-CoV 2 and
      Dengue virus infection and during alloimmunization, highlighting the in vivo
      significance of this phenomenon. This review aims to summarize the current
      knowledge about human IgG1 Fc core fucosylation and its regulation and function
      in vivo, in the context of both therapeutic antibodies and the natural immune
      response. The parallels in these two areas are informative about the mechanisms
      and in vivo effects of Fc core fucosylation, and may allow to further exploit the
      desired properties of this modification in different clinical contexts.

AB  - Although rare, dengue fever-associated ocular manifestations are a valid cause of
      visual impairment. Clinicians usually have a dilemma between vitrectomy and
      medical management if there is an associated vitreous hemorrhage. Vitrectomy has 
      been rarely reported previously in the management of vitreous hemorrhage
      secondary to dengue fever. We report a case of a young adult who presented with
      bilateral vitreous hemorrhages. The diagnosis of dengue was confirmed by serology
      and a typical epidemiological context. The patient presented already having
      undergone yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser hyaloidotomy for preretinal
      hemorrhage in the other eye, with a subsequent vitreous spread of the hemorrhage.
      Vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling was performed for the
      affected eye and the visual acuity was fully regained after a few weeks. Dengue
      fever can present with dense or sub-ILM hemorrhages. In our case, the vision
      quickly recovered after vitrectomy and ILM peeling. We, therefore, recommend
      early vitrectomy in cases with vitreous hemorrhage associated with sub-ILM
      involvement so as not to delay visual recovery.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) specific neutralizing and enhancing antibodies play crucial
      roles in dengue disease prevention and pathogenesis. DENV reporters are gaining
      popularity in the evaluation of these antibodies; their accessibility and
      acceptance may improve with more efficient production systems and indications of 
      their antigenic equivalence to the wild-type virus. This study aimed to generate 
      a replication competent luciferase-secreting DENV reporter (LucDENV2) and
      evaluate its feasibility in neutralizing and infection-enhancing antibody assays 
      in comparison with wild-type DENV2, strain 16681, and a luciferase-secreting,
      single-round infectious DENV2 reporter (LucSIP). LucDENV2 replicated to similarly
      high levels as that of the parent 16681 virus in a commonly used mosquito cell
      line. LucDENV2 was neutralized in an antibody concentration-dependent manner by a
      monoclonal antibody specific to the flavivirus fusion loop and two antibodies
      specific to the E domain III, which closely resembled the neutralization patterns
      employing the LucSIP and wild-type DENV2. Parallel analysis of LucDENV2 and
      wild-type DENV2 revealed good agreement between the luciferase-based and
      focus-based neutralization and enhancement assays in a 96-well microplate format 
      when employed against a set of clinical sera, suggesting comparable antigenic
      properties of LucDENV2 with those of the parent virus. The high-titer,
      replication competent, luciferase-secreting DENV reporter presented here should
      be a useful tool for fast and reliable quantitation of neutralizing and
      infection-enhancing antibodies in populations living in DENV-endemic areas.

TI  - FIRST REPORT OF AEDES VITTATUS IN ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN.
LID - 10.2987/22-7067 [doi]
AB  - Aedes vittatus is distributed throughout Asia, Africa, and Europe and can
      transmit dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses. Like other Aedes
      species, larvae develop in both natural and artificial containers in urban,
      suburban, and rural areas. In September 2021, an entomological survey was
      conducted at the National Institute of Health of Pakistan (NIH) and adjacent
      housing within the NIH colony. All containers with water were examined for Aedes 
      mosquitoes at 150 locations, including residential properties, a plant nursery,
      junkyards, and recreational parks and playgrounds. A total of 103 larvae, 37
      pupae, 5 female and 2 male Ae. vittatus were collected from a fountain. This was 
      the first detection of Ae. vittatus in urban Islamabad. Additional vector
      surveillance is needed to better understand the geographical distribution,
      ecology, and behavior of this invasive species and to understand its possible
      role in the transmission of dengue and chikungunya viruses in Pakistan.

PG  - 908398
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.908398 [doi]
AB  - An effective vaccine against the dengue virus (DENV) should induce a balanced,
      long-lasting antibody (Ab) response against all four viral serotypes. The burst
      of plasmablasts in the peripheral blood after vaccination may reflect enriched
      vaccine-specific Ab secreting cells. Here we characterize the acute plasmablast
      responses from naive and DENV-exposed individuals following immunization with the
      live attenuated tetravalent (LAT) Butantan DENV vaccine (Butantan-DV). The
      frequency of circulating plasmablasts was determined by flow cytometric analysis 
      of fresh whole blood specimens collected from 40 participants enrolled in the
      Phase II Butantan-DV clinical trial (NCT01696422) before and after (days 6, 12,
      15 and 22) vaccination. We observed a peak in the number of circulating
      plasmablast at day 15 after vaccination in both the DENV naive and the
      DENV-exposed vaccinees. DENV-exposed vaccinees experienced a significantly higher
      plasmablast expansion. In the DENV-naive vaccinees, plasmablasts persisted for
      approximately three weeks longer than among DENV-exposed volunteers. Our findings
      indicate that the Butantan-DV can induce plasmablast responses in both DENV-naive
      and DENV-exposed individuals and demonstrate the influence of pre-existing DENV
      immunity on Butantan DV-induced B-cell responses.

PG  - 44

AB  - Background: Myocarditis is a challenging diagnosis due to the heterogeneity of
      clinical presentations. Myocarditis can present with a mildly raised cardiac
      enzyme to severe myocarditis leading to congestive heart failure, arrhythmias,
      cardiogenic shock, and death. It is a predictor of morbidity and mortality in
      dengue-infected patients. The exact prevalence of dengue myocarditis and its
      outcomes are unknown in Pakistan. Objectives: We aim to study the prevalence and 
      association of myocarditis with the length of stay in the hospital and mortality 
      of dengue-infected patients. Methods: A retrospective observational study done at
      a tertiary care hospital. We reviewed hospital record files of 1008 consecutive
      patients with dengue viral infection admitted from November 2018 to November
      2019. Results: Out of 1008 dengue-infected patients, 55.4% of patients were older
      than 35 years and 68.4% were males. Hypertension (HTN) was the most common
      comorbid condition. The prevalence of myocarditis in hospitalized dengue-infected
      patients was 4.2%. All (100%) of dengue myocarditis patients had raised cardiac
      troponin I (cTn-I), 59.5% of patients had at least one electrocardiography (ECG) 
      change, and 24% had reduced ejection fraction (EF) (defined as EF < 55%). On
      multivariable analysis, patients with raised cTn-I levels (adjusted odds ratios =
      5.29; [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.16-12.96]) and abnormal echocardiography
      (ECHO) [aOR = 4.38; 95% CI: 1.26-15.27)] had a prolonged hospital stay (>3 days).
      Raised cTn-I levels (aOR = 8.2; [95% CI: 1.83-36.84]) was significantly
      associated with in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Raised cTn-I is the predictor
      of length of stay and in-hospital mortality in dengue-infected patients. Atrial
      fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, low serum bicarbonate, high serum 
      creatinine, and any abnormality on echocardiography were associated with adverse 
      outcomes in dengue-infected patients.

TI  - Corona versus Dengue: Distinct Mechanisms for Inhibition of Polyprotein
      Processing by Antiviral Drugs.
PG  - 508-511
LID - 10.1021/acsptsci.2c00105 [doi]
AB  - Inhibitors interfering with processing of the viral polyprotein are used
      successfully for the control of extremely important viral pathogens, such as HIV 
      and most recently SARS-CoV-2. This Viewpoint provides a mechanistic evaluation of
      a promising antiviral lead compound against dengue virus, JNJ-A07,
      4-(3-((1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-oxo-2-(6-(trifluoromethoxy)indolin-1-yl)ethyl)amino)-
      5-methoxyphenoxy)butanoic acid. The antiviral effect of JNJ-A07 appears, in our
      opinion, to be connected to an interference with the function of the viral
      protease. The analysis reveals for the first time that antiviral drugs target
      polyprotein processing not only by direct inhibition, but also by disturbing the 
      native sequence of cleavage events. Implications on the development of
      broad-spectrum antivirals against flaviviruses are addressed.

TI  - Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Miller Fisher Syndrome in Association With an
      Arboviral Outbreak: A Brazilian Case Series.
PG  - 911175
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.911175 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in association with arboviruses, such
      as Zika, chikungunya, and dengue, has been previously documented; however,
      Miller-Fisher Syndrome (MFS) and other GBS subtypes are rarely reported. Methods:
      We identified a series of GBS and MFS cases that were followed during the Zika
      virus outbreak in Salvador, Brazil (2015-2016). Blood and CSF samples were
      collected for virus diagnosis. In addition, serological studies to verify
      previous arboviral infection and electromyography (EMG) were performed. Results: 
      Of the 14 patients enrolled, 10 were diagnosed with GBS, including three GBS
      subtypes (two cases of bifacial weakness with paresthesia and one case of
      paraparetic GBS), and four as MFS. IgM antibodies against one or more of three
      arboviruses were present in 11 (78.6%) patients: anti-zika IgM positivity in
      eight (57%), anti-Chikungunya IgM in three (21%), and anti-Dengue in one (7%)
      individual. A single case was positive for both anti-Dengue IgM and
      anti-Chikungunya IgM, suggesting co-infection. EMG revealed an AIDP pattern in
      all nine patients analyzed. Conclusion: The current case series contributes to
      our knowledge on the clinical presentation of arbovirus-associated GBS and its
      subtypes, including MFS, and serves as an alert to clinicians and other
      healthcare professionals in regions affected by arbovirus outbreaks. We highlight
      the importance of recognizing arboviruses in diagnosing GBS and its subtypes.

TI  - Cross-platform mobile app development for disseminating public health information
      to travelers in Thailand: development and usability.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/s40794-022-00174-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of disease is a key factor that travelers have identified
      when planning to travel abroad, as many people are concerned about getting sick. 
      Mobile devices can be an effective means for travelers to access information
      regarding disease prevalence in their planned destinations, potentially reducing 
      the risk of exposure. METHODS: We developed a mobile app, ThaiEpidemics, using
      cross-platform technology to provide information about disease prevalence and
      status for travelers to Thailand. We aimed to assess the app's usability in terms
      of engagement, search logs, and effectiveness among target users. The app was
      developed using the principle of mobile application development life cycle, for
      both iOS and Android. As its data source, the app used weekly data from national 
      disease-surveillance reports. We conduced our study among visitors to the Travel 
      Clinic in the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine,
      Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. The participants were informed that the
      app would collect usage and search logs related to their queries. After the
      second log-in, the app prompted participants to complete an e-survey regarding
      their opinions and preferences related to their awareness of disease prevalence
      and status. RESULTS: We based our prototype of ThaiEpidemics on a conceptualized 
      framework for visualizing the distribution of 14 major diseases of concern to
      tourists in Southeast Asia. The app provided users with functions and features to
      search for and visualize disease prevalence and status in Thailand. The
      participants could access information for their current location and elsewhere in
      the country. In all, 83 people installed the app, and 52 responded to the
      e-survey. Regardless of age, education, and continent of origin, almost all
      e-survey respondents believed the app had raised their awareness of disease
      prevalence and status when travelling. Most participants searched for information
      for all 14 diseases; some searched for information specifically about dengue and 
      malaria. CONCLUSIONS: ThaiEpidemics is evidently potentially useful for
      travelers. Should the app be adopted for use by travelers to Thailand, it could
      have an impact on wider knowledge distribution, which might result in decreased
      exposure, increased prophylaxis, and therefore a potential decreased burden on
      the healthcare system. For app developers who are developing/implementing this
      kind of app, it is important to address standardization of the data source and
      users' concerns about the confidentiality and safety of their mobile devices.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This article shows how conceptual models can help to develop and
      evaluate public health interventions. It also reports on the challenges of
      getting stakeholders involved. METHOD: The analysis is based on the reflexive
      approach applied by the authors during their participation in two public health
      intervention research (PHIR) projects, in France and in Burkina Faso. RESULTS: In
      Paris, PHIR aimed to enable sub-Saharan immigrants to appropriate the existing
      means of prevention and sexual health care and to strengthen their empowerment in
      view of preserving their health. Evaluation was carried out using mixed methods. 
      The intervention process theory is based on Ninacs' conceptual model of
      individual empowerment. The Consolidated Framework For Implementation Research
      (CFIR) was mobilized a posteriori to analyze the process. PHIR stemmed from
      collaboration between a research team and two associations. The different
      stakeholders were involved in the evaluation process, as were, at certain times, 
      persons in highly precarious situations. In Ouagadougou, a community-based dengue
      vector control intervention was deployed to address an essential but neglected
      need. As regards evaluation, we opted for a holistic, mixed method approach
      (effectiveness and process). The contents of the intervention were determined
      based on tacit knowledge, a community preference survey and solid evidence. The
      theoretical framework of the intervention consisted in an eco-biological model of
      vector control. The implementation analysis combined an internal assessment of
      implementation fidelity with an external CFIR process analysis. All stakeholders 
      were involved in the evaluation process. DISCUSSION: Analysis confirmed not only 
      the value of process evaluations in PHIR, but also the primordial importance of a
      rigorous approach. Stakeholder involvement is a major challenge to be addressed
      early in the planning of RISPs; with this in mind, effective and ethically sound 
      assessment mechanisms need to be drawn up. Interdisciplinary evaluative
      approaches should be preferred, and the use of justified, relevant, and flexible 
      frameworks is highly recommended. CONCLUSION: Lessons learned for those wishing
      to engage in the process evaluation of a public health intervention are hereby
      presented.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus with a rapid spread to humans,
      causing mild to potentially fatal illness in hundreds of millions of people each 
      year. Due to the large number of serotypes of the virus, there remains an unmet
      need to develop protective vaccines for a broad spectrum of the virus. Here, we
      constructed a modified mRNA vaccine containing envelope domain III (E-DIII) and
      non-structural protein 1 (NS1) coated with lipid nanoparticles. This multi-target
      vaccine induced a robust antiviral immune response and increased neutralizing
      antibody titers that blocked all four types of DENV infection in vitro without
      significant antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In addition, there was more
      bias for Th1 than Th2 in the exact E-DIII and NS1-specific T cell responses after
      a single injection. Importantly, intramuscular immunization limited DENV
      transmission in vivo and eliminated vascular leakage. Our findings highlight that
      chimeric allogeneic structural and non-structural proteins can be effective
      targets for DENV vaccine and that they can prevent the further development of
      congenital DENV syndrome.

TI  - A specific EMC subunit supports Dengue virus infection by promoting virus
      membrane fusion essential for cytosolic genome delivery.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) represents the most common human arboviral infection, yet its
      cellular entry mechanism remains unclear. The multi-subunit endoplasmic reticulum
      membrane complex (EMC) supports DENV infection, in part, by assisting the
      biosynthesis of viral proteins critical for downstream replication steps.
      Intriguingly, the EMC has also been shown to act at an earlier step prior to
      viral protein biogenesis, although this event is not well-defined. Here we
      demonstrate that the EMC subunit EMC4 promotes fusion of the DENV and endosomal
      membranes during entry, enabling delivery of the viral genome into the cytosol
      which is then targeted to the ER for viral protein biosynthesis. We also found
      that EMC4 mediates ER-to-endosome transfer of phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid 
      whose presence in the endosome facilitates DENV-endosomal membrane fusion. These 
      findings clarify the EMC-dependent DENV early entry step, suggesting a mechanism 
      by which an ER-localized host factor can regulate viral fusion at the endosome.

TI  - Biocidal action, characterization, and molecular docking of Mentha piperita
      (Lamiaceae) leaves extract against Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae)
      larvae.
PG  - e0270219

AB  - Mosquitoes are found in tropical and subtropical areas and are the carriers of a 
      variety of diseases that are harmful to people's health. e.g., malaria,
      filariasis, chikungunya, dengue fever, etc. Although several insecticides are
      available, however, due to insect resistance and environmental hazards, more
      eco-friendly chemicals are needed for insect control. So, the current research
      was planned to explore the prospective of Mentha piperita to be used for the
      formulation of larvicides against mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. The ethanolic 
      and water extracts of M. piperita leaves were prepared using the soxhlet
      apparatus. The extracts were dried and subjected to prepare five concentrations
      multiple of 80 ppm. Each concentration was applied for its larvicidal efficacy
      setting an experiment (in triplicate) in plastic containers of 1000 ml with
      extracts, 30 larvae of all four instars separately, and fed with dog biscuits
      along with controls. Observations were taken after each 12 hrs. till 72 hrs. The 
      antioxidant perspective of M. piperita was determined by DPPH radical scavenging,
      total antioxidant capacity, and ferric reducing power assays. Using brine shrimp 
      lethality bioactivity, the cytotoxic study was perceived. Standard techniques
      were used to classify the M. piperita extract using preliminary qualitative and
      quantitative phytochemicals, UV-Vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, and GC-MS analysis. M.
      piperita ethanolic leaves extract after 24 hrs. of exposure in 400 ppm showed 93%
      (LC50 = 208.976 ppm) mortality in ethanolic extract and 80% (LC90 = 246.900 ppm) 
      in the water extract. In treated larvae, biochemical examination revealed a
      substantial (P<0.05) decrease in proteins, carbohydrates, and fat contents. The
      ethanol extract of M. piperita was the most efficient, killing brine shrimp
      nauplii in 50% to 90% of cases. TAC (125.4 3.5gAAE/mg DW) and FRP (378.1
      1.0gAAE/mg DW) were highest in the ethanolic extract of M. piperita. The presence
      of medicinally active components such as alkaloids, carbohydrates, flavonoids,
      and others in M. piperita leaves extract in ethanol was discovered. The UV-Vis
      spectrum showed two peaks at 209.509 and 282.814 nm with the absorption of 2.338 
      and 0.796 respectively. The FT-IR consequences exhibited the occurrence of
      alcohols, alkanes, aldehyde, aromatic rings, ether linkage, ester, and halo-
      compounds. The GC-MS analysis according to peak (%) area and retention time
      showed ten phytochemicals consisting of six major and four minor compounds. Among
      all the compounds, 1, 2-benzene dicarboxylic acid, and 3-ethyl-5, 5-dimethyl
      -6-phenyl bound well to the NS3 protease domain with PDB ID: 2FOM. Hence, for the
      prevention of health hazards and mosquito control, M. Piperita is a potential
      source of chemicals for insecticide formulation.

TI  - Mice immunized with trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles containing DENV-2 envelope
      domain III elicit neutralizing antibodies with undetectable antibody-dependent
      enhancement activity.

AB  - Dengue is a disease that poses a significant global public health concern.
      Although a tetravalent live-attenuated dengue vaccine has been licensed, its
      efficacy is still debated due to evidence of vaccine breakthrough infection. To
      avoid this issue, dengue vaccines should stimulate a high degree of
      serotype-specific response. Thus, envelope domain III (EDIII), which contains
      serotype-specific neutralizing epitopes, is an attractive target for dengue
      vaccine development. In this study, we investigated how EDIII encapsidated in N, 
      N, N-trimethyl chitosan chloride nanoparticles (TMC NPs) stimulates a
      serotype-specific response and whether this response exerts a potential in vitro 
      breakthrough infection. The immune response to DENV-2 elicited by EDIII TMC
      NP-immunized mice was monitored. We demonstrated that immunization with EDIII TMC
      NPs resulted in a high level of anti-EDIII antibody production. These antibodies 
      included IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a subtypes. Importantly, antibodies from the
      immunized mice exerted efficient neutralizing activity with undetectable antibody
      dependent enhancement (ADE) activity. We also found that EDIII TMC NPs activated 
      functional EDIII-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses. In conclusion,
      EDIII TMC NPs stimulated humoral immunity with a strong neutralizing antibody
      response, as well as a cellular immune response against DENV-2.

AB  - Co-infection of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has been recently reported during
      dengue fever epidemics. However, the infection of CHIKV is often neglected due to
      its misdiagnosis as dengue virus (DENV) infection. In the summer of 2019 when
      dengue fever was epidemic, we collected 697 serum samples from febrile dengue
      fever-like patients in Xishuangbanna, southwestern part of China. DENV RNA was
      detectable in 99.42% of these patients. Notably, 88 patients (12.62%) showed the 
      presence of CHIKV RNA, among which 86 patients were co-infected with DENV and
      CHIKV. We sequenced and analyzed the full genome of CHIKV virus in four out of 88
      samples (two CHIKV infected and two co-infected). The results suggested that the 
      four strains were all Asian genotype and had the highest homology (99.4%) with
      the SZ1239 strain (accession number MG664851) isolated in 2012 and possibly
      introduced from Indonesia. Further comparison with the conserved sequences in the
      whole genome of 47 strains of CHIKV showed that there were 13 and 15 amino acid
      mutants in structural proteins and non-structural proteins, respectively. The
      previously reported adaptive mutations of E2-W64R, E2-I211T, E2-K233E, E1-A98T,
      and E1-K211E occurred in the four strains of this study. In conclusion, this
      study reports a co-infection of CHIKV during the DENV epidemic in the city
      Xishuangbanna, 2019. Molecular epidemiology revealed that CHIKV identified in
      this study was indigenous and belongs to Asian lineage with lineage-specific
      mutations and some reported adaptive mutations, which is distinct from the
      recently reported CHIKV (East/Central/South African) in Ruili, the city next to
      Xishuangbanna.

TI  - Fcgamma RIIb protects from reperfusion injury by controlling antibody and type I 
      IFN-mediated tissue injury and death.
LID - 10.1111/imm.13547 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) is accompanied by an exacerbated
      inflammatory response characterized by deposition of IgG, release of inflammatory
      mediators, and intense neutrophil influx in the small intestine, resulting in
      severe tissue injury and death. We hypothesized that Fcgamma RIIb activation by
      deposited IgG could inhibit tissue damage during I/R. Our results showed that I/R
      induction led to the deposition of IgG in intestinal tissue during the
      reperfusion phase. Death upon I/R occurred earlier and was more frequent in
      Fcgamma RIIb(-/-) than WT mice. The higher lethality rate was associated with
      greater tissue injury and bacterial translocation to other organs. Fcgamma
      RIIb(-/-) mice presented changes in the amount and repertoire of circulating IgG,
      leading to increased IgG deposition in intestinal tissue upon reperfusion in
      these mice. Depletion of intestinal microbiota prevented antibody deposition and 
      tissue damage in Fcgamma RIIb(-/-) mice submitted to I/R. We also observed
      increased production of ROS on neutrophils harvested from the intestines of
      Fcgamma RIIb(-/-) mice submitted to I/R. In contrast, Fcgamma RIII(-/-) mice
      presented reduced tissue damage and neutrophil influx after reperfusion injury, a
      phenotype reversed by Fcgamma RIIb blockade. In addition, we observed reduced
      IFN-beta expression in the intestines of Fcgamma RIII(-/-) mice after I/R, a
      phenotype that was also reverted by blocking Fcgamma RIIb. IFNAR(-/-) mice
      submitted to I/R presented reduced lethality and TNF release. Altogether our
      results demonstrate that antibody deposition triggers Fcgamma RIIb to control
      IFN-beta and IFNAR activation and subsequent TNF release, tailoring tissue
      damage, and death induced by reperfusion injury.

AB  - The potential of small molecules to localize within subcellular compartments is
      rarely explored. To probe this question, we measured the localization of Hsp70
      inhibitors using fluorescence microscopy. We found that even closely related
      analogs had dramatically different distributions, with some residing
      predominantly in the mitochondria and others in the ER. CRISPRi screens supported
      this idea, showing that different compounds had distinct chemogenetic
      interactions with Hsp70s of the ER (HSPA5/BiP) and mitochondria (HSPA9/mortalin) 
      and their co-chaperones. Moreover, localization seemed to determine function,
      even for molecules with conserved binding sites. Compounds with distinct
      partitioning have distinct anti-proliferative activity in breast cancer cells
      compared with anti-viral activity in cellular models of Dengue virus replication,
      likely because different sets of Hsp70s are required in these processes. These
      findings highlight the contributions of subcellular partitioning and chemogenetic
      interactions to small molecule activity, features that are rarely explored during
      medicinal chemistry campaigns.

TI  - Linguistic Pattern-Infused Dual-Channel Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory With
      Attention for Dengue Case Summary Generation From the Program for Monitoring
      Emerging Diseases-Mail Database: Algorithm Development Study.
PG  - e34583
LID - 10.2196/34583 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globalization and environmental changes have intensified the
      emergence or re-emergence of infectious diseases worldwide, such as outbreaks of 
      dengue fever in Southeast Asia. Collaboration on region-wide infectious disease
      surveillance systems is therefore critical but difficult to achieve because of
      the different transparency levels of health information systems in different
      countries. Although the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED)-mail is
      the most comprehensive international expert-curated platform providing rich
      disease outbreak information on humans, animals, and plants, the unstructured
      text content of the reports makes analysis for further application difficult.
      OBJECTIVE: To make monitoring the epidemic situation in Southeast Asia more
      efficient, this study aims to develop an automatic summary of the alert articles 
      from ProMED-mail, a huge textual data source. In this paper, we proposed a text
      summarization method that uses natural language processing technology to
      automatically extract important sentences from alert articles in ProMED-mail
      emails to generate summaries. Using our method, we can quickly capture crucial
      information to help make important decisions regarding epidemic surveillance.
      METHODS: Our data, which span a period from 1994 to 2019, come from the
      ProMED-mail website. We analyzed the collected data to establish a unique Taiwan 
      dengue corpus that was validated with professionals' annotations to achieve
      almost perfect agreement (Cohen kappa=90%). To generate a ProMED-mail summary, we
      developed a dual-channel bidirectional long short-term memory with attention
      mechanism with infused latent syntactic features to identify key sentences from
      the alerting article. RESULTS: Our method is superior to many well-known machine 
      learning and neural network approaches in identifying important sentences,
      achieving a macroaverage F1 score of 93%. Moreover, it can successfully extract
      the relevant correct information on dengue fever from a ProMED-mail alerting
      article, which can help researchers or general users to quickly understand the
      essence of the alerting article at first glance. In addition to verifying the
      model, we also recruited 3 professional experts and 2 students from related
      fields to participate in a satisfaction survey on the generated summaries, and
      the results show that 84% (63/75) of the summaries received high satisfaction
      ratings. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach successfully fuses latent syntactic
      features into a deep neural network to analyze the syntactic, semantic, and
      contextual information in the text. It then exploits the derived information to
      identify crucial sentences in the ProMED-mail alerting article. The experiment
      results show that the proposed method is not only effective but also outperforms 
      the compared methods. Our approach also demonstrates the potential for case
      summary generation from ProMED-mail alerting articles. In terms of practical
      application, when a new alerting article arrives, our method can quickly identify
      the relevant case information, which is the most critical part, to use as a
      reference or for further analysis.

TI  - High Performance Integration Pipeline for Viral and Epitope Sequences.
LID - 7 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biotech11010007 [doi]
AB  - With the spread of COVID-19, sequencing laboratories started to share hundreds of
      sequences daily. However, the lack of a commonly agreed standard across
      deposition databases hindered the exploration and study of all the viral
      sequences collected worldwide in a practical and homogeneous way. During the
      first months of the pandemic, we developed an automatic procedure to collect,
      transform, and integrate viral sequences of SARS-CoV-2, MERS, SARS-CoV, Ebola,
      and Dengue from four major database institutions (NCBI, COG-UK, GISAID, and
      NMDC). This data pipeline allowed the creation of the data exploration interfaces
      VirusViz and EpiSurf, as well as ViruSurf, one of the largest databases of
      integrated viral sequences. Almost two years after the first release of the
      repository, the original pipeline underwent a thorough refinement process and
      became more efficient, scalable, and general (currently, it also includes
      epitopes from the IEDB). Thanks to these improvements, we constantly update and
      expand our integrated repository, encompassing about 9.1 million SARS-CoV-2
      sequences at present (March 2022). This pipeline made it possible to design and
      develop fundamental resources for any researcher interested in understanding the 
      biological mechanisms behind the viral infection. In addition, it plays a crucial
      role in many analytic and visualization tools, such as ViruSurf, EpiSurf,
      VirusViz, and VirusLab.

AB  - Background: International tourist travel has been increasingly steadily in recent
      years, and looks set to reach unprecedented levels in the coming decades. Among
      these travellers, an increasing proportion is aged over 60 years, and is healthy 
      and wealthy enough to be able to travel. However, senior travellers have specific
      risks linked to their age, health and travel patterns, as compared to their
      younger counterparts. Methods: We review here the risk of major
      vaccine-preventable travel-associated infectious diseases, and forms and efficacy
      of vaccination for these diseases. Results: Routine vaccinations are recommended 
      for older persons, regardless of whether they travel or not (e.g., influenza,
      pneumococcal vaccines). Older individuals should be advised about the vaccines
      that are recommended for their age group in the framework of the national
      vaccination schedule. Travel-specific vaccines must be discussed in detail on a
      case-by-case basis, and the risk associated with the vaccine should be carefully 
      weighed against the risk of contracting the disease during travel.
      Travel-specific vaccines reviewed here include yellow fever, hepatitis,
      meningococcal meningitis, typhoid fever, cholera, poliomyelitis, rabies, Japanese
      encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis and dengue. Conclusion: The number of older
      people who have the good health and financial resources to travel is rising
      dramatically. Older travellers should be advised appropriately about routine and 
      travel-specific vaccines, taking into account the destination, duration and
      purpose of the trip, the activities planned, the type of accommodation, as well
      as patient-specific characteristics, such as health status and current
      medications.

AB  - Zika virus is an RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus family that is chiefly
      transmitted by the female Aedes mosquito. The Zika virus first infected humans in
      Uganda and Tanzania in 1952. Since, it has spread to several parts of the world
      causing outbreaks of variable extent. In India, these outbreaks have been
      reported from Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Kerala, and
      Maharashtra. The most recent outbreak is from the most populous state of India,
      Uttar Pradesh, where the climate is conducive to the breeding and transmission of
      other arboviral infections such as Dengue, Chikungunya, and Malaria. These
      infections also happen to share similar incubation periods and overlapping
      clinical manifestations with Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, leading to misdiagnoses
      or delayed diagnosis. We aim to provide an account of the outbreak, its
      repercussions, errors made in attempting to contain the spread of the disease,
      and, measures to be taken in the future.

AB  - Aedes aegypti (L.), the yellow fever mosquito, is also an important vector of
      dengue and Zika viruses, and an invasive species in North America. Aedes aegypti 
      inhabits tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world and in North America, is
      primarily distributed throughout the southern US states and Mexico. The northern 
      range of Ae. aegypti is limited by cold winter months and establishment in these 
      areas has been mostly unsuccessful. However, frequent introductions of Ae.
      aegypti to temperate, non-endemic areas during the warmer months can lead to
      seasonal activity and disease outbreaks. Two Ae. aegypti incursions were reported
      in the late summer of 2019 into York, Nebraska and Moab, Utah. These states had
      no history of established populations of this mosquito and no evidence of
      previous seasonal activity. We genotyped a subset of individuals from each
      location at 12 microsatellite loci and~14,000 single nucleotide polymorphic
      markers to determine their genetic affinities to other populations worldwide and 
      investigate their potential source of introduction. Our results support a single 
      origin for each of the introductions from different sources. Aedes aegypti from
      Utah likely derived from Tucson, Arizona, or a nearby location. Nebraska specimen
      results were not as conclusive, but point to an origin from southcentral or
      southeastern US. In addition to an effective, efficient, and sustainable control 
      of invasive mosquitoes, such as Ae. aegypti, identifying the potential routes of 
      introduction will be key to prevent future incursions and assess their potential 
      health threat based on the ability of the source population to transmit a
      particular virus and its insecticide resistance profile, which may complicate
      vector control.

TI  - Susceptibility to endemic Aedes-borne viruses among pregnant women in Risaralda, 
      Colombia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aedes-borne viruses (ABV) affect humans on every inhabited continent
      and frequently cause epidemics. Recent epidemics of chikungunya and Zika viruses 
      highlight that preparedness for future epidemics requires assessment of
      susceptibility, particularly among high-risk groups. We sought to determine
      immunity against the three major circulating ABV among pregnant women in an
      ABV-endemic area of Colombia. METHODS: A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was
      performed, enrolling women presenting to Labor and Delivery. Cord blood and
      maternal peripheral blood was obtained. IgG seroprevalence to flaviviruses and
      chikungunya was determined by ELISA. An abbreviated neutralization test was used 
      to estimate the frequency and magnitude of immunity to Zika and four dengue
      serotypes. Cluster analyses explored epidemiologic factors associated with
      seroprevalence. RESULTS: Most women exhibited high levels of neutralizing
      antibodies to one or more ABV; however, nearly 20% were seronegative for
      flaviviruses. Our research took place after the epidemic peak of the ZIKV
      outbreak in Colombia in 2016, but only 20% of pregnant women had high levels of
      Zika-neutralizing antibodies consistent with likely protective immunity to ZIKV. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Hence, a high proportion pregnant women in Risaralda remain
      susceptible to one or more ABV including the teratogenic ZIKV, indicating risk
      for future epidemics in this region.

AB  - Dengue virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and dengue is endemic in many
      regions of the world. Severe dengue results in complications that may lead to
      death. Although some vaccine candidates are in clinical trials and one vaccine
      Dengvaxia, with restricted efficacy, is available, there are currently no
      specific therapies to completely prevent or treat dengue. The dengue virus
      structural protein E (envelope) exists as a head-to-tail dimer on mature virus,
      is targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies and is suitable for developing
      vaccine immunogens. Here, we have used a redesigned dengue prME expression
      construct and immunoaffinity chromatography with conformational/quaternary
      antibody A11 to purify soluble DENV4 sE(A259C) (E ectodomain) dimers from
      mammalian expression system to ~99 % purity. These dimers retain glycosylation
      reported for native DENV E, display the three major broadly neutralizing antibody
      epitopes, and form well-ordered structure. This strategy can be used for
      developing subunit vaccine candidates against dengue and other flaviviruses.

      liver involvement. These include viruses, outside the scope of regular
      hepatotropic viruses (hepatitis A, -B(D), -C, -E, CMV, EBV), that can be found in
      (sub)tropical areas causing "exotic viral hepatitis". Transmission routes are
      mostly arthropod born (Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, dengue, Rift Valley
      fever, yellow fever). However, others are transmitted by the aerosolised excreta 
      of rodents (Hantavirus, Lassa fever), or via direct contact or contact with
      bodily fluids (Ebola). Although some exotic viruses are known for their high
      fatality rate, such as Ebola for example, the clinical presentation of most
      exotic viruses can range from mild flu-like symptoms, as in most cases, right
      through to being potentially fatal. A smaller percentage of people develop severe
      disease with haemorrhagic fever, possibly with (fulminant) hepatitis. Liver
      involvement is often caused by direct tropism for hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, 
      resulting in virus-mediated and/or immune-mediated necrosis. In all exotic
      hepatitis viruses, PCR is the most sensitive diagnostic method. The determination
      of IgM/IgG antibodies is a reasonable alternative, but cross-reactivity can be a 
      problem in the case of flaviviruses. Licenced vaccines are available for yellow
      fever and Ebola, and they are currently under development for dengue. Therapy for
      exotic viral hepatitis is predominantly supportive. To ensure that preventive
      measures can be introduced to control possible outbreaks, the timely detection of
      these viruses is very important.

AB  - Dengue is one of the most typical viral infection categorized in the Neglected
      Tropical Diseases (NTDs). It is transmitted via the female Aedes aegypti mosquito
      to humans and majorly puts risk to the lives of more than half of the world.
      Recent advancements in medicinal chemistry have led to the design and development
      of numerous potential heterocyclic scaffolds as antiviral drug candidates for the
      inhibition of the dengue virus (DENV). Thus, in this review, we have discussed
      the significance of inhibitory and antiviral activities of nitrogen, oxygen, and 
      mixed (nitrogen-sulfur and nitrogen-oxygen) heterocyclic scaffolds that are
      published in the last seven years (2016-2022). Furthermore, we have also
      discussed the probable mechanisms of action and the diverse structure-activity
      relationships (SARs) of the heterocyclic scaffolds. In addition, this review has 
      elaborately outlined the mechanism of viral infection and the life cycle of DENV 
      in the host cells. The wide set of heterocycles and their SARs will aid in the
      development of pharmaceuticals that will allow the researchers to synthesize the 
      promising anti-dengue drug candidate in the future.

TI  - Estimating dengue transmission intensity from serological data: A comparative
      analysis using mixture and catalytic models.
PG  - e0010592
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010592 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a global health concern of
      increasing magnitude. To target intervention strategies, accurate estimates of
      the force of infection (FOI) are necessary. Catalytic models have been widely
      used to estimate DENV FOI and rely on a binary classification of serostatus as
      seropositive or seronegative, according to pre-defined antibody thresholds.
      Previous work has demonstrated the use of thresholds can cause serostatus
      misclassification and biased estimates. In contrast, mixture models do not rely
      on thresholds and use the full distribution of antibody titres. To date, there
      has been limited application of mixture models to estimate DENV FOI. METHODS: We 
      compare the application of mixture models and time-constant and time-varying
      catalytic models to simulated data and to serological data collected in Vietnam
      from 2004 to 2009 (N >/= 2178) and Indonesia in 2014 (N = 3194). RESULTS: The
      simulation study showed larger mean FOI estimate bias from the time-constant and 
      time-varying catalytic models (-0.007 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): -0.069,
      0.029) and -0.006 (95% CI -0.095, 0.043)) than from the mixture model (0.001 (95%
      CI -0.036, 0.065)). Coverage of the true FOI was > 95% for estimates from both
      the time-varying catalytic and mixture model, however the latter had reduced
      uncertainty. When applied to real data from Vietnam, the mixture model frequently
      produced higher FOI and seroprevalence estimates than the catalytic models.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest mixture models represent valid, potentially less
      biased, alternatives to catalytic models, which could be particularly useful when
      estimating FOI from data with largely overlapping antibody titre distributions.

AB  - Viral diseases are prominent among the widely spread infections threatening human
      well-being. Real-life clinical successes of the few available therapeutics are
      challenged by pathogenic resistance and suboptimal delivery to target sites.
      Nanotechnology has aided the design of functionalised and non-functionalised Au
      and Ag nanobiomaterials through physical, chemical and biological (green
      synthesis) methods with improved antiviral efficacy and delivery. In this review,
      innovative designs as well as interesting antiviral activities of the
      nanotechnology-inclined biomaterials of Au and Ag, reported in the last 5 years
      were critically overviewed against several viral diseases affecting man. These
      include influenza, respiratory syncytial, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory
      syndromes (SARS), rotavirus, norovirus, measles, chikungunya, HIV, herpes simplex
      virus, dengue, polio, enterovirus and rift valley fever virus. Notably identified
      among the nanotechnologically designed promising antiviral agents include
      AuNP-M2e peptide vaccine, AgNP of cinnamon bark extract and AgNP of oseltamivir
      for influenza, PVP coated AgNP for RSV, PVP-AgNPs for SARS-CoV-2, AuNRs of a
      peptide pregnancy-induce d hypertension and AuNP nanocarriers of antigen for
      MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV respectively. Others are AgNPs of collagen and Bacillus
      subtilis for rotavirus, AgNPs labelled Ag30-SiO 2 for murine norovirus in water, 
      AuNPs of Allium sativum and AgNPs of ribavirin for measles, AgNPs of Citrus
      limetta and Andrographis Paniculata for Chikungunya, AuNPs of efavirenz and
      stavudine, and AgNPs-curcumin for HIV, NPAuG3-S8 for HSV, AgNPs of Moringa
      oleifera and Bruguiera cylindrica for dengue while AgNPs of polyethyleneimine and
      siRNA analogues displayed potency against enterovirus. The highlighted candidates
      are recommended for further translational studies towards antiviral therapeutic
      designs.

AB  - Bacteria, viruses, and parasites are harmful microorganisms that cause infectious
      diseases. Early detection of diseases is critical to prevent disease transmission
      and provide epidemic preparedness, as these can cause widespread deaths and
      public health crises, particularly in resource-limited countries. Lateral flow
      assay (LFA) systems are simple-to-use, disposable, inexpensive diagnostic devices
      to test biomarkers in blood and urine samples. Thus, LFA has recently received
      significant attention, especially during the pandemic. Here, first of all, the
      design principles and working mechanisms of existing LFA methods are examined.
      Then, current LFA implementation strategies are presented for communicable
      disease diagnoses, including COVID-19, zika and dengue, HIV, hepatitis,
      influenza, malaria, and other pathogens. Furthermore, this review focuses on an
      overview of current problems and accessible solutions in detecting infectious
      agents and diseases by LFA, focusing on increasing sensitivity with various
      detection methods. In addition, future trends in LFA-based diagnostics are
      envisioned.

TI  - Dengue Virus-2 Infection Affects Fecundity and Elicits Specific Transcriptional
      Changes in the Ovaries of Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes.
PG  - 886787
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.886787 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever (DF), caused by the dengue virus (DENV), is the most burdensome
      arboviral disease in the world, with an estimated 400 million infections each
      year. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the main vector of DENV and transmits several
      other human pathogens, including Zika, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses.
      Previous studies have shown that the pathogen infection of mosquitoes can alter
      reproductive fitness, revealing specific vector-pathogen interactions that are
      key determinants of vector competence. However, only a handful of studies have
      examined the effect of DENV infection in A. aegypti, showing a reduction in
      lifespan and fecundity over multiple blood meals. To provide a more comprehensive
      analysis of the impact of DENV infection on egg laying and fecundity, we assessed
      egg laying timing in DENV-2 blood-fed mosquitoes (infected group) compared to
      mock blood-fed mosquitoes (control group). We confirmed a significant decrease in
      fecundity during the first gonadotrophic cycle. To further investigate this
      phenotype and the underlying DENV-2 infection-dependent changes in gene
      expression, we conducted a transcriptomic analysis for differentially expressed
      genes in the ovaries of A. aegypti infected with DENV-2 vs. mock-infected
      mosquitoes. This analysis reveals several DENV-2-regulated genes; among them, we 
      identified a group of 12 metabolic genes that we validated using reverse
      transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Interestingly, two genes found to be
      upregulated in DENV-infected mosquito ovaries exhibited an antiviral role for
      DENV-2 in an Aedes cell line. Altogether, this study offers useful insights into 
      the virus-vector interface, highlighting the importance of gene expression
      changes in the mosquito's ovary during DENV-2 infection in the first
      gonadotrophic cycle, triggering antiviral responses that may possibly interfere
      with mosquito reproduction. This information is extremely relevant for further
      investigation of A. aegypti's ability to tolerate viruses since virally infected 
      mosquitoes in nature constitute a powerful source of supporting viruses during
      intra-epidemic periods, causing a huge burden on the public health system.

TI  - Hypercalcemia - An enigmatic cause of acute pancreatitis.
PG  - 176-180
AB  - Background: Acute pancreatitis (AP) continues to be one of the common abdominal
      emergencies encountered in tertiary care hospitals. The majority of AP is caused 
      by gall stones and alcohol. Hypercalcemia though uncommon has been reported to
      cause AP, recurrent AP, and chronic pancreatitis (CP). Aim: The aim of this study
      was to describe hypercalcemia-induced AP in different settings. Materials and
      Methods: In total 100 patients with AP, admitted from January 2021 to December
      2021 at our center, etiologies were biliary (36%), alcohol (19%), idiopathic
      (21%), alcohol plus Biliary (5%), post-endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreaticography (7%), drug-induced (6%), hypercalcemia (3%), and
      dengue infection (3%). Overall mortality was 11%. Results: In three patients with
      hypercalcemia-induced pancreatitis, causes of hypercalcemia were multiple
      myeloma, parathyroid adenoma leading to hyperparathyroidism, and hypervitaminosis
      D in association with hyperthyroidism. Conclusion: Hypercalcemia-induced AP is
      not a rare phenomenon and should be actively investigated to prevent further
      attacks of AP and progression to CP. Relevance for Patients: Hypercalcemia is a
      potentially treatable cause of AP and its identification will not only help to
      treat and prevent further episodes of pancreatitis but also to manage underlying 
      diseases leading to hypercalcemia.

TI  - Dengue and Chikungunya virus circulation in Cameroon and Gabon: molecular
      evidence among symptomatic individuals.
PG  - 000340
LID - 10.1099/acmi.0.000340 [doi]
AB  - We report the molecular evidence of dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus
      (CHIKV) infection in symptomatic individuals in Cameroon and Gabon, respectively.
      Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are distributed in the tropical or
      subtropical regions, with DENV having the highest burden. The morbidity and
      mortality related to arboviral diseases raise the concern of timely and efficient
      surveillance and care. Our aim was to assess the circulation of arboviruses
      [DENV, CHIKV, Zika virus (ZIKV)] among febrile patients in Dschang (West
      Cameroon) and Kye-ossi (South Cameroon, border with Gabon and Equatorial Guinea).
      Dried blood spots were collected from 601 consenting febrile patients, and 194
      Plasmodium spp.-negative samples were tested for the molecular detection of cases
      of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV infection. Overall, no case of ZIKV infection was found, 
      whereas one case of DENV infection and one case of CHIKV infection were detected 
      in Dschang and Kye-ossi, respectively, with the CHIKV-infected patient being
      resident in Gabon. Our findings suggest the need to establish an active
      surveillance of arbovirus transmission in Cameroon and bordering countries.

TI  - Direct Medical Costs of Tetanus, Dengue, and Sepsis Patients in an Intensive Care
      Unit in Vietnam.
PG  - 893200
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.893200 [doi]
AB  - Background: Critically ill patients often require complex clinical care by highly
      trained staff within a specialized intensive care unit (ICU) with advanced
      equipment. There are currently limited data on the costs of critical care in
      low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aims to investigate the
      direct-medical costs of key infectious disease (tetanus, sepsis, and dengue)
      patients admitted to ICU in a hospital in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, and
      explores how the costs and cost drivers can vary between the different diseases. 
      Methods: We calculated the direct medical costs for patients requiring critical
      care for tetanus, dengue and sepsis. Costing data (stratified into different cost
      categories) were extracted from the bills of patients hospitalized to the adult
      ICU with a dengue, sepsis and tetanus diagnosis that were enrolled in three
      studies conducted at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in HCMC from January 2017
      to December 2019. The costs were considered from the health sector perspective.
      The total sample size in this study was 342 patients. Results: ICU care was
      associated with significant direct medical costs. For patients that did not
      require mechanical ventilation, the median total ICU cost per patient varied
      between US$64.40 and US$675 for the different diseases. The costs were higher for
      patients that required mechanical ventilation, with the median total ICU cost per
      patient for the different diseases varying between US$2,590 and US$4,250. The
      main cost drivers varied according to disease and associated severity.
      Conclusion: This study demonstrates the notable cost of ICU care in Vietnam and
      in similar LMIC settings. Future studies are needed to further evaluate the costs
      and economic burden incurred by ICU patients. The data also highlight the
      importance of evaluating novel critical care interventions that could reduce the 
      costs of ICU care.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common arbovirus, causing a significant burden on
      both the economy and global healthcare systems. The virus is transmitted by Aedes
      species of mosquitoes as a swarm of closely related virus genomes, collectively
      referred to as a quasispecies. The level of genomic diversity within this
      quasispecies varies as DENV moves through various ecological niches within its
      transmission cycle. Here, the factors that influence the level of DENV
      quasispecies diversity during the course of infection in the mosquito vectors are
      reviewed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Observing the serological cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and
      dengue virus (DV), we aimed to elucidate its effect on dengue serodiagnosis and
      infectivity in a highly dengue-endemic city in India. METHODS: A total of 52
      COVID-19 (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] positive)
      serum samples were tested in rapid lateral flow immunoassays and DV
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect DV or 
      SARS-CoV-2 IgG/immunoglobulin M. The COVID-19 antibody (Ab) positive samples were
      subjected to a virus neutralization test (Huh7 cells) using DV type 1 (DV1)
      clinical isolate. RESULTS: Most (93%) of the SARS-CoV-2 Ab-positive serum samples
      cross-reacted with DV in rapid or ELISA tests. All were DV RNA and nonstructural 
      protein 1 (NS1) antigen-negative. COVID-19 serum samples that were DV
      cross-reactive neutralized DV1. Of these, 57% had no evidence of DV pre-exposure 
      (DV NS1 Ab-negative). The computational study also supported potential
      interactions between SARS-CoV-2 Ab and DV1. CONCLUSION: DV serodiagnosis will be 
      inconclusive in areas co-endemic for both viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic appears 
      to impart a protective response against DV in DV-endemic populations.

AB  - In November 2015, cases of Zika virus infection were recorded in Cabo Verde
      (Africa), originating from Brazil. The outbreak subsided after seven months with 
      7580 suspected cases. We performed a serological survey (n = 431) in Praia, the
      capital city, 3 months after transmission ceased. Serum samples were screened for
      arbovirus antibodies using ELISA techniques and revealed seroconverted
      individuals with Zika (10.9%), dengue (1-4) (12.5%), yellow fever (0.2%) and
      chikungunya (2.6%) infections. Zika seropositivity was predominantly observed
      amongst females (70%). Using a logistic model, risk factors for increased odds of
      Zika seropositivity included age, self-reported Zika infection, and dengue
      seropositivity. Serological data from Zika and dengue virus assays were strongly 
      correlated (Spearman's rs = 0.80), which reduced when using a double antigen
      binding ELISA (Spearman's rs = 0.54). Overall, our work improves an understanding
      of how Zika and other arboviruses have spread throughout the Cabo Verde
      population. It also demonstrates the utility of serological assay formats for
      outbreak investigations.

      hierarchical analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, is a major public health
      problem in Sri Lanka. Weather affects the abundance, feeding patterns, and
      longevity of Aedes vectors and hence the risk of dengue transmission. We aimed to
      quantify the effect of weather variability on dengue vector indices in ten
      Medical Officer of Health (MOH) divisions in Kalutara, Sri Lanka. METHODS:
      Monthly weather variables (rainfall, temperature, and Oceanic Nino Index [ONI])
      and Aedes larval indices in each division in Kalutara were obtained from 2010 to 
      2018. Using a distributed lag non-linear model and a two-stage hierarchical
      analysis, we estimated and compared division-level and overall relationships
      between weather and premise index, Breteau index, and container index. FINDINGS: 
      From Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2018, three El Nino events (2010, 2015-16, and 2018)
      occurred. Increasing monthly cumulative rainfall higher than 200 mm at a lag of 0
      months, mean temperatures higher than 31.5 degrees C at a lag of 1-2 months, and 
      El Nino conditions (ie, ONI >0.5) at a lag of 6 months were associated with an
      increased relative risk of premise index and Breteau index. Container index was
      found to be less sensitive to temperature and ONI, and rainfall. The associations
      of rainfall and temperature were rather homogeneous across divisions.
      INTERPRETATION: Both temperature and ONI have the potential to serve as
      predictors of vector activity at a lead time of 1-6 months, while the amount of
      rainfall could indicate the magnitude of vector prevalence in the same month.
      This information, along with knowledge of the distribution of breeding sites, is 
      useful for spatial risk prediction and implementation of effective Aedes control 
      interventions. FUNDING: None.

TI  - A Computational Approach Applied to the Study of Potential Allosteric Inhibitors 
      Protease NS2B/NS3 from Dengue Virus.
LID - 4118 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134118 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a danger to more than 400 million people in the world, and
      there is no specific treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop an
      effective method to combat this pathology. NS2B/NS3 protease is an important
      biological target due it being necessary for viral replication and the fact that 
      it promotes the spread of the infection. Thus, this study aimed to design DENV
      NS2B/NS3pro allosteric inhibitors from a matrix compound. The search was
      conducted using the Swiss Similarity tool. The compounds were subjected to
      molecular docking calculations, molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and free
      energy calculations. The molecular docking results showed that two compounds,
      ZINC000001680989 and ZINC000001679427, were promising and performed important
      hydrogen interactions with the Asn152, Leu149 and Ala164 residues, showing the
      same interactions obtained in the literature. In the MD, the results indicated
      that five residues, Lys74, Leu76, Asn152, Leu149 and Ala166, contribute to the
      stability of the ligand at the allosteric site for all of the simulated systems. 
      Hydrophobic, electrostatic and van der Waals interactions had significant effects
      on binding affinity. Physicochemical properties, lipophilicity, water solubility,
      pharmacokinetics, druglikeness and medicinal chemistry were evaluated for four
      compounds that were more promising, showed negative indices for the potential
      penetration of the Blood Brain Barrier and expressed high human intestinal
      absorption, indicating a low risk of central nervous system depression or
      drowsiness as the the side effects. The compound ZINC000006694490 exhibited an
      alert with a plausible level of toxicity for the purine base chemical moiety,
      indicating hepatotoxicity and chromosome damage in vivo in mouse, rat and human
      organisms. All of the compounds selected in this study showed a synthetic
      accessibility (SA) score lower than 4, suggesting the ease of new syntheses. The 
      results corroborate with other studies in the literature, and the computational
      approach used here can contribute to the discovery of new and potent anti-dengue 
      agents.

AB  - Numerical models help us to understand the transmission dynamics of infectious
      diseases. Since vectors transmit many diseases, vector host models are very
      important. The transmission dynamics of Dengue fever with an incubation period of
      the virus with fuzzy parameters have been analyzed in this article. Sometimes it 
      is very difficult and almost impossible to collect numerical data as a fixed
      value. Due to the lack of precise numerical data for the parameters, the fuzzy
      model is considered here. Fuzzy theory is a very powerful mathematical tool for
      dealing with imprecision and uncertainties. In this article, the chance of the
      occurrence of dengue infection betah(a), the recovery rate r(a) and the mortality
      rate of the human population muh(a) due to dengue fever are considered fuzzy
      numbers. The stability of equilibrium points of the model has been determined and
      a reproduction number has been derived respectively in a fuzzy sense. A numerical
      model is designed for the studied model having fuzzy parameters and some
      numerical experiments are performed which indicate that the proposed method shows
      positivity, stability, and convergence at each time step size. Hence the method
      preserves the essential features of the dynamic epidemic models.

AB  - Flaviviruses, such as Dengue and Zika viruses, infect millions of people
      worldwide using mosquitos as vectors. In this issue of Cell, Zhang et al. reveal 
      how these viruses manipulate the skin microbiome of infected hosts in a way that 
      increases vector recruitment and viral spread. They propose vitamin A as a way to
      counteract the virus and decrease transmission.

TI  - Severity and Outcomes of Dengue in Hospitalized Jamaican Children in 2018-2019
      During an Epidemic Surge in the Americas.
PG  - 889998
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.889998 [doi]
AB  - Objective: In 2019, dengue was among the "top-ten threats to global health," with
      3.1 million cases reported from the Americas, the highest ever. Simultaneously,
      Jamaica reported its largest dengue outbreak in 40 years, following Chikungunya
      and Zika virus epidemics, in 2014 and 2016-2017, respectively. We describe dengue
      in children admitted to five hospitals in Jamaica during August 2018 through
      September 2019. Methods: Hospitalized children and adolescents aged 0 to 15 years
      with dengue were managed using PAHO/WHO criteria. Data were extracted from
      questionnaires, entered into a dataset on Microsoft Excel version 2016, exported 
      to SPSS version 20 and analyzed. Groups were compared using Student's t-test for 
      normally distributed parametric data. Chi-square analysis, or Fisher's exact test
      was used for categorical variables. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
      significant. Results: There were 339 children, 245 (72.3%) aged 1-10 years,
      males:females 1:1. Classification was "dengue without warning signs" 53 (15.3%), 
      "dengue with warning signs" 218 (64.3%) and "severe dengue" 68 (20%).
      Co-morbidities were reported in 88 (26%). Hemoglobin SC disease was associated
      with severe dengue with hemorrhage (p = 0.005). Organ-system involvement occurred
      in 334 (98.5%) including gastrointestinal 317 (93.5%), hematologic 311 (91.7%)
      and musculoskeletal 180 (53.1%). Thirty-nine (11.5%) had 5-7 organ-systems
      involved. Metabolomics emphasized increased hepatic transaminases 245 (72.3%),
      lactate dehydrogenase 164 (48.4%) and creatine phosphokinase 84 (24.8%)
      approaching the high thousands (121,560 u/L), both were markers for severe
      disease (p < 0.002). Thirteen (3.8%) received intensive care. Dengue was
      laboratory-confirmed in 220 (78.9%): NS1 antigen-positive (218); RT-PCR-positive 
      (23), with an overlap of NS1 antigen and RT-PCR positive (21); DENV-3 serotype
      (20). Seventeen (5%) died, 16 (94.1%) had severe dengue and 11 (64.7%) succumbed 
      within 24 to 48 h of admission despite resuscitation and transfusion of blood
      products. Conclusion: Severe dengue with increased attributable mortality
      occurred in hospitalized children after Jamaica's maiden Zika epidemic.

PG  - 2241-2245
LID - 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_2058_21 [doi]
AB  - Fulminant hepatitis is a potentially life-threatening disease that is evident
      through the findings of organ dysfunction, jaundice, and hepatomegaly, which is
      painful. Dysfunction of the endothelial cells and thus the damage of the
      endothelium is the probable mechanism, which is responsible for causing
      complications of hepatobiliary system in patients with sickle cell disease.
      Various acute as well as chronic manifestations of the hepatobiliary system,
      having varied severity and pathophysiology are associated with sickle cell
      disease. Dengue fever may also affect the liver starting from asymptomatic liver 
      enzyme derangement to fulminant hepatic failure. This case series describes the
      first ever association of fulminant hepatic failure resulting from the
      synergistic effect of dengue fever with sickle cell disease and thus highlights
      the importance of prevention of dengue fever in sickle cell patients, thereby
      preventing potentially lethal fulminant hepatic failure.

AB  - Dengue and Zika viruses cocirculate annually in endemic areas of Mexico, causing 
      outbreaks of different magnitude and severity every year, suggesting a continuous
      selection of Flavivirus variants with variable phenotypes of transmissibility and
      virulence. To evaluate if Flavivirus variants with different phenotypes
      cocirculate during outbreaks, we isolated dengue and Zika viruses from blood
      samples of febrile patients from Oaxaca City during the 2016 and 2019 epidemic
      years. We compared their replication kinetics in human cells, susceptibility to
      type I interferon antiviral response, and the accumulation of subgenomic RNA on
      infected cells. We observed correlations between type I interferon susceptibility
      and subgenomic RNA accumulation, with high hematocrit percentage and
      thrombocytopenia. Our results suggest that Flaviviruses that cocirculate in
      Oaxaca, Mexico, have variable sensitivity to the antiviral activity of type I
      interferons, and this phenotypic trait correlates with the severity of the
      disease.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is an arboviral disease affecting more than 400 million
      people annually. Only a single vaccine formulation is available commercially and 
      many others are still under clinical trials. Despite all the efforts in vaccine
      designing, the improvement in vaccine formulation against DENV is very much
      needed. In this study, we used a roboust immunoinformatics approach, targeting
      all the four serotypes of DENV to design a multi-epitope vaccine. A total of
      13501 MHC II binding CD4+ epitope peptides were predicted from polyprotein
      sequences of four dengue virus serotypes. Among them, ten conserved epitope
      peptides that were interferon-inducing were selected and found to be conserved
      among all the four dengue serotypes. The vaccine was formulated using antigenic, 
      non-toxic and conserved multi epitopes discovered in the in-silico study.
      Further, the molecular docking and molecular dynamics predicted stable
      interactions between predicted vaccine and immune receptor, TLR-5. Finally, one
      of the mapped epitope peptides was synthesized for the validation of antigenicity
      and antibody production ability where the in-vivo tests on rabbit model was
      conducted. Our in-vivo analysis clearly indicate that the imunogen designed in
      this study could stimulate the production of antibodies which further suggest
      that the vaccine designed possesses good immunogenicity.

TI  - Leveraging geo-referenced malaria information to increase domestic financial
      support for malaria elimination in Thailand.
PG  - 213

AB  - Thailand's National Malaria Elimination Strategy 2017-2026 seeks to increase
      domestic support and financing for malaria elimination. During 2018-2020, through
      a series of training sessions, public health officials in Thailand utilized
      foci-level malaria data to engage subdistrict-level government units known as
      Local Administrative Organizations (LAOs) with the aim of increasing their
      understanding of their local malaria situation, collaboration with public health 
      networks, and advocacy for financial support of targeted interventions in
      villages within their jurisdictions. As a result of these efforts, total LAO
      funding support for malaria nearly doubled from the 2017 baseline to 2020. In
      2021, a novel "LAO collaboration" feature was added to Thailand's national
      malaria information system that enables tracking and visualization of LAO
      financial support of malaria in areas with transmission, by year, down to the
      subdistrict level. This case study describes Thailand's experience implementing
      the LAO engagement strategy, quantifying and monitoring the financial support
      mobilized from LAOs, and results from a qualitative study in five
      high-performance provinces examining factors and approaches that foster
      successful local collaboration between LAOs, public health networks, and
      communities for malaria prevention and response. Results from the study showed
      that significant malaria endemicity or local outbreaks helped spur collaboration 
      in multiple provinces. Increases in LAO support and involvement were attributable
      to four approaches employed by public health officials: (a) strengthening malaria
      literacy and response capacity of LAOs, (b) organizational leadership in response
      to outbreaks, (c) utilization of structural incentives, and (d) multisectoral
      involvement in malaria response. In two provinces, capacity building of LAOs in
      malaria vector control, following a precedent set by Thailand's dengue programme,
      enabled LAO personnel to play both funding and implementation roles in local
      malaria response. Wider replication of the LAO engagement strategy across
      Thailand may sustain gains and yield efficiencies in the fight against malaria as
      the vector-borne disease workforce declines. Lessons from Thailand's experience
      may be useful for malaria programmes in other geographies to support the goals
      and sustainability of elimination and prevention of re-establishment by improving
      financing through local collaboration between the health system and elected
      officials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first described in
      December 2019, in China. In addition, there has also been an increase in
      arboviral infections in recent years. As both infections have similar symptoms,
      misdiagnosis may occur if both outbreaks occur at the same time. OBJECTIVE: Our
      objective was to assess the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on
      diagnostic assays used for arboviral diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      conducted this study by testing samples obtained during the precovid phase
      (before November 2019) and during the covid period (after February 2020). Samples
      were further grouped as those with acute febrile illness (AFI) and those without.
      All samples were tested for anti SARS-CoV-2 Ab, Chikungunya and Dengue specific
      IgM antibodies to evaluate potential serological cross-reactions between COVID-19
      and Arbovirus specific antibodies. RESULTS: One sample from the 62 cases of AFI
      during the pre-covid phase showed seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Also,
      in asymptomatic individuals, arboviral seropositivity was significantly higher in
      the COVID period samples (22%) compared to pre-COVID samples (3%). CONCLUSION:
      Due to similar clinical symptoms and cross reactions in both infections, relying 
      solely on serological testing for arboviral diagnosis may be less sensitive;
      other clinical and laboratory parameters may be required.

AB  - Dengue is classified as an endemic infectious disease, which is transmitted by
      Aedes mosquitos. Kinetic studies, which monitor the viral load of the disease,
      have been the mainstay for several decades in humanity's quest to control this
      disease. Our study aims to systematically evaluate the usage of different timing 
      systems in dengue kinetic studies. A search in nine electronic databases and
      manual search of reference and citation lists were conducted to find relevant
      studies. A quality assessment using the National Institute of Health tools for
      observational cohort and cross-sectional studies was performed. The protocol was 
      registered in PROSPERO with number CRD42018086435. As results, among included 87 
      studies, 71 studies (81.6%) use a timing system which is based on the day of
      illness onset, of which, 11 studies designate the day of illness onset as "day
      0'' (type 1A) while 60 studies designate it as "day 1'' (type 1B). Only ten
      articles (11.5%) designate the day of defervescence as "day 0'', the day before
      and after defervescence as "day -1'' and "day +1'', respectively. Four articles
      (4.6%) use a timing system based on the day of hospital admission. Lastly, two
      studies (2.3%) designate the day of hemorrhagic manifestation as "day 0'' and two
      studies (2.3%) designate the day of pharmacological treatment as "day 1''.
      Therefore, the timing system which designates the day of illness onset as "day
      1'' (type 1B) was most commonly used. Inconsistent definitions of "day 0'' and
      "day 1'' may lead to disparities in results across the studies and may have a
      negative impact on treatment guidelines implementation.

AB  - CRISPR-mediated genome engineering technologies have been adapted to a wide
      variety of organisms with high efficiency and specificity. The yellow fever
      mosquito, Aedes aegypti , is one such organism. It is also responsible for
      transmitting a wide variety of deadly viruses including Dengue, Zika, Yellow
      fever, and Chikungunya. The key to successful CRISPR-mediated gene editing
      applications is the delivery of both Cas9 ribonuclease and single-guide RNA
      (sgRNA ) to the nucleus of desired cells. Various methods have been developed for
      supplying the Cas9 endonuclease, sgRNA , and donor DNA to Ae. aegypti. In this
      chapter, we focus on methods of direct embryo delivery of editing components,
      presenting detailed step-by-step CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing protocols for
      inducing desired heritable edits in mosquitoes as well as insights into
      successful application of these protocols. We also highlight potential
      opportunities for customizing these protocols to manipulate the mosquito genome
      for innovative in vivo gene function studies.

LID - 10.1016/j.jve.2022.100077 [doi]
AB  - Background: The risk of transfusion transmitted dengue (DENV) is increasingly
      recognized and poses a risk to blood safety as well as spreading into non-immune 
      communities. Objectives: To determine dengue serological profile, environmental
      risk, knowledge, and preventive measures among blood donors in a national blood
      bank in northern Egypt. Methods: A total of 500 blood donors were enrolled into
      this study between June and September 2018. Socio-demographic and medical data
      were collected using a predesigned questionnaire. Blood samples were screened for
      anti-DENV IgM, anti-DENV IgG and non-structural protein 1 antigen (DENV-NS1
      antigen). Results: History of past dengue exposure was identified in 10.2% of
      blood donors. No samples (0.0%) tested positive for anti-DENV IgG, IgM or NS1
      antigen. At the time of blood donation, no individuals had any symptoms
      suggestive of a dengue-related illness. Dengue exposure strongly correlated with 
      travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Sudan and the El-Quseir outbreak
      area in Egypt. Knowledge of dengue and prevention methods was found to be
      substantially deficient, and the relatively higher level of knowledge among
      exposed donors did not translate into appropriate preventative measures.
      Conclusions: Our risk assessment shows the impact of travel on DENV exposure and 
      highlights its potential threat to disease spread in Egypt. Dengue awareness
      programs are urgently needed for effective prevention of transmission.

AB  - Chemokines form a sophisticated communication network wherein they maneuver the
      spatiotemporal migration of immune cells across a system. These chemical
      messengers are recognized by chemokine receptors, which can trigger a cascade of 
      reactions upon binding to its respective ligand. CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3)
      is a transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor, which can selectively bind to
      CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. CXCR3 is predominantly expressed on immune cells,
      including activated T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. It thus plays a
      crucial role in immunological processes like homing of effector cells to
      infection sites and for pathogen clearance. Additionally, it is expressed on
      several cell types of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, due
      to which it has been implicated in several central nervous system disorders,
      including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, dengue viral disease, and
      glioblastoma, as well as cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis, Chronic
      Chagas cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. This review provides a narrative
      description of the evolution, structure, function, and expression of CXCR3 and
      its corresponding ligands in mammals and zebrafish and the association of CXCR3
      receptors with cardiovascular and neuronal disorders. Unraveling the mechanisms
      underlying the connection of CXCR3 and disease could help researchers investigate
      the potential of CXCR3 as a biomarker for early diagnosis and as a therapeutic
      target for pharmacological intervention, along with developing robust zebrafish
      disease models.

TI  - Milk exosomes elicit a potent anti-viral activity against dengue virus.
PG  - 317
LID - 10.1186/s12951-022-01496-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by various cells into the
      intra and extracellular space and hence is an integral part of biological fluids 
      including milk. In the last few decades, many research groups have proved the
      potential of milk exosomes as a sustainable, economical and non-immunogenic drug 
      delivery and therapeutic agent against different pathological conditions.
      However, its anti-viral properties still remain to be unearthed. METHODS: Here,
      we have been able to isolate, purify and characterize the milk derived exosomes
      from Cow (CME) and Goat (GME) and further studied its antiviral properties
      against Dengue virus (DENV), Newcastle Disease Virus strain Komarov (NDV-K) and
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) using an in-vitro infection system. RESULTS:
      TEM, NTA and DLS analysis validated the appropriate size of the isolated cow and 
      goat milk exosomes (30-150 nm). Real-time PCR and immunoblotting results
      confirmed the presence of several milk exosomal miRNAs and protein markers. Our
      findings suggest that GME significantly decreased the infectivity of DENV. In
      addition, we confirmed that GME significantly reduces DENV replication and
      reduced the secretion of mature virions. Furthermore, heat inactivation of GME
      did not show any inhibition on DENV infection, replication, and secretion of
      mature virions. RNase treatment of GME abrogates the anti-viral properties
      indicating direct role of exosomes in DENV inhibition. In addition GME inhibited 
      the infectivity of NDV-K, but not HIV-1, suggesting that the GME mediated
      antiviral activity might be virus specific. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates
      the anti-viral properties of milk exosomes and opens new avenues for the
      development of exosome-based therapies to treat viral diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dengue infection is a growing public health problem, with the number 
      of reported cases increasing in the Americas and worldwide. This review
      characterized the epidemiological and economic burden of dengue in Brazil.
      METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, evidence-based review databases, and gray literature
      sources were searched for published literature and surveillance reports on
      epidemiology (between 2000 and 2019) and costs (between 2009 and 2019) of dengue 
      in Brazil. Studies were included if they reported data on incidence,
      seroprevalence, serotype distribution, expansion factors, hospitalization,
      mortality, or costs. Data were summarized descriptively and reported following
      the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
      guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 344 publications were included (167 peer-reviewed
      and 177 gray literature). Dengue outbreaks increased in incidence and frequency, 
      with the highest incidence observed in 2015 at 807 cases per 100,000 population. 
      Outbreaks were related to alternating predominant serotypes. Dengue was more
      frequent in young adults (aged 20-39 years) and in the Midwest. Cost and societal
      impacts are substantial and varied across regions, age, and public/private
      delivery of healthcare services. CONCLUSION: The burden of dengue in Brazil is
      increasing and likely underestimated. Therefore, developing and implementing new 
      strategies, including vaccination, is essential to reduce the disease burden.

TI  - First comprehensive analysis of Aedes aegypti bionomics during an arbovirus
      outbreak in west Africa: Dengue in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, 2016-2017.
PG  - e0010059
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue's emergence in West Africa was typified by the Burkina Faso
      outbreaks in 2016 and 2017, the nation's largest to date. In both years, we
      undertook three-month surveys of Aedes populations in or near the capital city
      Ouagadougou, where the outbreaks were centered. METHODOLOGY: In 1200LG (urban),
      Tabtenga (peri-urban) and Goundry (rural) localities, we collected indoor and
      outdoor resting mosquito adults, characterized larval habitats and containers
      producing pupae and reared immature stages to adulthood in the laboratory for
      identification. All mosquito adults were identified morphologically. Host species
      (from which bloodmeals were taken) were identified by PCR. Generalized mixed
      models were used to investigate relationships between adult or larval densities
      and multiple explanatory variables. RESULTS: From samples in 1,780 houses, adult 
      Ae. aegypti were significantly more abundant in the two urban localities
      (Tabtenga and 1200 LG) in both years than in the rural site (Goundry), where
      Anopheles spp. were far more common. Results from adult collections indicated a
      highly exophilic and anthropophilic (>90% bloodmeals of human origin) vector
      population, but with a relatively high proportion of bloodfed females caught
      inside houses. Habitats producing most pupae were waste tires (37% of total
      pupae), animal troughs (44%) and large water barrels (30%). While Stegomyia
      indices were not reliable indicators of adult mosquito abundance, shared
      influences on adult and immature stage densities included rainfall and container 
      water level, collection month and container type/purpose. Spatial analysis showed
      autocorrelation of densities, with a partial overlap in adult and immature stage 
      hotspots. CONCLUSION: Results provide an evidence base for the selection of
      appropriate vector control methods to minimize the risk, frequency and magnitude 
      of future outbreaks in Ouagadougou. An integrated strategy combining
      community-driven practices, waste disposal and insecticide-based interventions is
      proposed. The prospects for developing a regional approach to arbovirus control
      in West Africa or across Africa are discussed.

TI  - City puzzles: Does urban land scape affect genetic population structure in Aedes 
      aegypti?
PG  - e0010549
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010549 [doi]
AB  - Cities usually offer a suitable environment for the dengue vector Aedes aegypti, 
      providing oviposition sites, accessibility to human hosts and nectar meals.
      However, large urban centres are highly heterogeneous environments, forming a
      patched landscape that could affect Ae. aegypti population dynamics and
      dispersal. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis using Rad-seq data from 99
      Ae. aegypti specimens collected in three areas within Buenos Aires city with
      varying levels of urbanization/land use: highly urbanized Area 1, intermediate
      Area 2 and poorly urbanized Area 3. We found an inverse association between
      urbanization levels and spatial genetic structure. Populations from highly
      urbanized Area 1 did not present genetic structure whereas two and three clusters
      were detected in Areas 2 and 3, respectively. In the case of Area 3, initial
      analyses showed separation in clusters was mostly due to elevated consanguinity
      within sites although three clusters were still detected after closely related
      individuals were discarded. Mosquitoes around each site displayed a high degree
      of isolation, evidencing a close dependence between the vector and human
      dwellings. Interestingly, specimens from distant boroughs (within the limits of
      the city) and the city's outskirts formed a single cluster with inner city sites 
      (Area 1), highlighting the role of passive transport in shaping population
      structure. Genetic distances were poorly correlated with geographic distances in 
      Buenos Aires, suggesting a stronger influence of passive than active dispersal on
      population structure. Only Area 2 displayed a significant isolation-by-distance
      pattern (p = 0.046), with males dispersing more than females (p = 0.004 and p =
      0.016, respectively). Kinship analyses allowed us to detect full-siblings located
      1.5 km apart in Area 1, which could be due to an extreme event of active female
      dispersal. Effective population size was higher in Area 2 confirming that
      cemeteries represent highly favourable environments for Ae. aegypti and need to
      be specifically targeted. Our results suggest that control programs should take
      into account urban landscape heterogeneity in order to improve vector control.

TI  - The main component of the scent of Senecio madagascariensis flowers is an
      attractant for Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes.

AB  - Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) is one of the main vectors of
      arboviruses, including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. It almost exclusively
      inhabits urban areas. Both sexes feed on plant carbohydrates, although for males,
      this is their only food source. In the case of floral nectars, mosquitoes locate 
      plant sugar sources assisted by volatile compounds. In this work, we found that
      the floral scent of Senecio madagascariensis elicited a behavioral response in
      males; therefore, we focused on identifying the volatiles emitted by these
      flowers. The terpenes (+/-)-alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, sabinene, and phellandrene
      and 1-alkenes 1-undecene, and 1-nonene were identified. To determine which
      compounds are bioactive, pure synthetic lures were assessed using an
      olfactometer. Only the main compound 1-nonene was an attractant for males. Since 
      our goal was the introduction of synthetic floral-based attractants in toxic
      sugar-baited traps, we formulated 1-nonene in solid paraffin and stearin matrices
      to obtain a controlled release system. The bioassay with a toxicological end
      point showed that the incorporation of a feeding attractant to the toxic sugar
      trap increased overall mortality. These results suggest that it is possible to
      use plant volatile compounds or flower cuttings as male Ae. aegypti attractants
      to improve the efficacy of baited traps.

AB  - Dengue fever is a clinical manifestation of dengue virus (DENV) infection well
      defined by the intense host immune response with the development of high fever,
      anorexia, headache and muscle pain. Several immune mediators are involved in the 
      pathophysiology of DENV infection, in which polymorphisms in immune molecule
      genes contribute with the susceptibility and severity of the infection. Several
      meta-analyses are available with significant findings in the association between 
      genetic variants in immune-mediator genes and dengue, though the results may be
      false positive. Hence, to solve this issue, we have performed a systematic
      revaluation with Bayesian approaches to verify the false positive rate in these
      results. A systematic search was performed for meta-analytic studies on the
      aforementioned issue. The calculations of false positive report probability
      (FPRP) and the Bayesian false-discovery probability (BFDP) at the prior
      probability of 10(-3) and 10(-6) have been performed. To verify the
      methodological quality of the studies included, the evaluation by the Venice
      criteria was applied. In addition, gene-gene and protein-protein networks were
      designed. As results, seven meta-analyses on genetic variants in several
      immune-inflammatory mediator genes and DENV infection comprise the results. Only 
      the polymorphisms in the TNF, MICB, PLCE1, VDR, CD32 and HLA-A genes were
      considered as noteworthy. There was a heterogeneity profile for the results on
      Venice criteria indicating variability in the methodological quality. The
      gene-gene and protein-protein networks showed these immune mediators as relevant 
      players in the disease. We suggest these polymorphisms as potential biomarkers
      for the pathogenesis and immune response against DENV.

AB  - A woman in her 30s had robotic pyeloplasty done for right ureteropelvic junction 
      obstruction. Incidentally she developed dengue viral fever starting on
      postoperative day 1 itself, which progressed to dengue haemorrhagic shock by 1
      week, complicating pyeloplasty due to pelvicalyceal haematoma. Dengue associated 
      shock was superimposed with subsequent gram-negative bacterial sepsis, further
      complicated later with Trichosporon fungal sepsis. She was managed under
      multidisciplinary care, involving urology, infectious disease and ICU care. Her
      diagnostic and difficult management issues due to these rare sequential medical
      issues in an otherwise usually uncomplicated postsurgical phase are discussed
      along with short review of literature. This case highlights the importance of
      early diagnosis, timely supportive care and appropriate management in such
      tropical infections with significant associated mortality.

TI  - The epidemiology and disease burden of children hospitalized for viral infections
      within the family Flaviviridae in China: A national cross-sectional study.
PG  - e0010562
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010562 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viruses of the family Flaviviridae, including Japanese encephalitis
      virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and hepatitis C virus 
      (HCV), are widely distributed worldwide. JEV, DENV and YFV belong to the genus
      Flavivirus, whereas HCV belongs to the genus Hepacivirus. Children's symptoms are
      usually severe. As a result, rates of hospitalization due to infection with these
      viruses are high. The epidemiology and disease burden of hospitalized children
      have rarely been described in detail to date. The objective of this study was to 
      report the general epidemiological characteristics, clinical phenotype, length of
      stay (LOS), burden of disease, and potential risk factors for hospitalized
      children infected with JEV, DENV, YFV, or HCV in Chinese pediatric hospitals.
      METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study of epidemiology and disease burden of
      children hospitalized for Flaviviridae virus infections between December 2015 and
      December 2020 in China was performed. Face sheets of discharge medical records
      (FSMRs) were collected from 27 tertiary children's hospitals in the Futang
      Research Center of Pediatric Development and aggregated into FUTang Update
      medical REcords (FUTURE). Information on sociodemographic variables, clinical
      phenotype, and LOS as well as economic burden was included in FSMRs and compared 
      using appropriate statistical tests. FINDINGS: The study described 490 children
      aged 0-15 years hospitalized for infections with Flaviviridae viruses. Japanese
      encephalitis (JE) cases are the highest, accounting for 92.65% of the total
      hospitalization cases caused by Flaviviridae virus infection. The incidence of JE
      peaked from July to October with a profile of a high proportion of severe cases
      (68.06%) and low mortality (0.44%). Rural children had a significantly higher
      incidence than urban children (91.63%). Most hospitalized dengue cases were
      reported in 2019 when dengue outbreaks occurred in many provinces of China,
      although only 14 dengue cases were collected during the study period. Yellow
      fever (YF) is still an imported disease in China. The hospitalizations for
      children with hepatitis C (HC) were not high, and mild chronic HC was the main
      clinical phenotype of patients. Among the four viral infections, JE had the
      highest disease burden (LOS and expenditure) for hospitalized children.
      CONCLUSION: First, the present study reveals that JE remains the most serious
      disease due to Flaviviridae virus infection and threatens children's health in
      China. Many pediatric patients have severe illnesses, but their mortality rate is
      lower, suggesting that existing treatment is effective. Both JEV vaccination and 
      infection control of rural children should represent a focus of study. Second,
      although the dual risks of indigenous epidemics and imports of DENV still exist, 
      the prevalence of DENV in children is generally manageable. Third, YFV currently 
      shows no evidence of an epidemic in China. Finally, the proportion of children
      with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is relatively large among hospitalized children
      diagnosed with HCV. Thus, early and effective intervention should be offered to
      children infected with HCV to ease the burden of CHC on public health.

TI  - Larvicidal Activity of Two Rutaceae Plant Essential Oils and Their Constituents
      Against Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Multiple Formulations.
LID - tjac083 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjac083 [doi]
AB  - Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is a vector of several arboviruses, such as dengue,
      chikungunya, West Nile, and Zika viruses. At present, the use of synthetic
      insecticides is the main vector control strategy. However, the widespread and
      long-term use of insecticides has aroused several problems, including insecticide
      resistance, environmental pollution, and non-target species effects, thereby
      encouraging researchers to search for new alternatives derived from natural
      products. In recent decades, essential oils (EOs) as natural alternatives to
      control mosquitoes have received increasing attention. In the initial larvicidal 
      activity screen, two Rutaceae plants (Citrus aurantium and Citrus paradisi) EOs
      were selected and evaluated for killing Ae. albopictus larvae. The LC50 values of
      C. aurantium and C. paradisi EOs against Ae. albopictus were 91.7 and 100.9 ppm, 
      respectively. The main components of C. aurantium EO include diethyl o-phthalate 
      (37.32%), limonene (10.04%), and methyl dihydrojasmonate (6.48%). The main
      components of C. paradisi EO include limonene (60.51%), diethyl o-phthalate
      (11.75%), linalool (7.90%), and styralyl acetate (6.28%). Among these main
      components of the two EOs, limonene showed potent larvicidal activity, with the
      LC50 value of 39.7 ppm. The nanoemulsions of limonene were prepared and
      characterized. The duration of larvicidal activity was greater in the limonene
      nanoemulsions than when limonene was applied in solvent. This study demonstrates 
      that EOs of plants in family Rutaceae are a potential resource to develop new
      larvicides, and nanoemulsification is an effective method for improving the
      physicochemical properties and efficacy of natural products as larvicides.

PG  - 48
LID - 10.1186/s12929-022-00833-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many countries in Asia and Latin America are currently facing a
      double burden of outbreaks due to dengue and COVID-19. Here we discuss the
      similarities and differences between the two infections so that lessons learnt so
      far from studying both infections will be helpful in further understanding their 
      immunopathogenesis and to develop therapeutic interventions. MAIN BODY: Although 
      the entry routes of the SARS-CoV-2 and the dengue virus (DENV) are different,
      both infections result in a systemic infection, with some similar clinical
      presentations such as fever, headache, myalgia and gastrointestinal symptoms.
      However, while dengue is usually associated with a tendency to bleed, development
      of micro and macrothrombi is a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Apart from the
      initial similarities in the clinical presentation, there are further similarities
      between such as risk factors for development of severe illness, cytokine storms, 
      endothelial dysfunction and multi-organ failure. Both infections are
      characterised by a delayed and impaired type I IFN response and a proinflammatory
      immune response. Furthermore, while high levels of potent neutralising antibodies
      are associated with protection, poorly neutralising and cross-reactive antibodies
      have been proposed to lead to immunopathology by different mechanisms, associated
      with an exaggerated plasmablast response. The virus specific T cell responses are
      also shown to be delayed in those who develop severe illness, while varying
      degrees of endothelial dysfunction leads to increased vascular permeability and
      coagulation abnormalities. CONCLUSION: While there are many similarities between 
      dengue and SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are also key differences especially in
      long-term disease sequelae. Therefore, it would be important to study the
      parallels between the immunopathogenesis of both infections for development of
      more effective vaccines and therapeutic interventions.

AB  - The Flaviviridae are a family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA enveloped
      viruses, and their members belong to a single genus, Flavivirus. Flaviviruses are
      found in mosquitoes and ticks; they are etiological agents of: dengue fever,
      Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus infection, Zika virus infection,
      tick-borne encephalitis, and yellow fever, among others. Only a few flavivirus
      vaccines have been licensed for use in humans: yellow fever, dengue fever,
      Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and Kyasanur forest disease.
      However, improvement is necessary in vaccination strategies and in understanding 
      of the immunological mechanisms involved either in the infection or after
      vaccination. This is especially important in dengue, due to the immunological
      complexity of its four serotypes, cross-reactive responses, antibody-dependent
      enhancement, and immunological interference. In this context, mucosal vaccines
      represent a promising alternative against flaviviruses. Mucosal vaccination has
      several advantages, as inducing long-term protective immunity in both mucosal and
      parenteral tissues. It constitutes a friendly route of antigen administration
      because it is needle-free and allows for a variety of antigen delivery systems.
      This has promoted the development of several ways to stimulate immunity through
      the direct administration of antigens (e.g., inactivated virus, attenuated virus,
      subunits, and DNA), non-replicating vectors (e.g., nanoparticles, liposomes,
      bacterial ghosts, and defective-replication viral vectors), and replicating
      vectors (e.g., Salmonella enterica, Lactococcus lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
      and viral vectors). Because of these characteristics, mucosal vaccination has
      been explored for immunoprophylaxis against pathogens that enter the host through
      mucosae or parenteral areas. It is suitable against flaviviruses because this
      type of immunization can stimulate the parenteral responses required after bites 
      from flavivirus-infected insects. This review focuses on the advantages of
      mucosal vaccine candidates against the most relevant flaviviruses in either
      humans or animals, providing supporting data on the feasibility of this
      administration route for future clinical trials.

      Disease.

AB  - Despite a well-known association between gut barrier defect (leaky gut) and
      several diseases, data on translocation of pathogen molecules, including
      bacterial DNA (blood bacteriome), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and serum
      (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (BG), from the gut to the blood circulation (gut
      translocation) in dengue are still less studied. Perhaps, dengue infection might 
      induce gut translocation of several pathogenic molecules that affect the disease 
      severity. At the enrollment, there were 31 dengue cases in febrile and critical
      phases at 4.1 +/- 0.3 days and 6.4 +/- 1.1 days of illness, respectively, with
      the leaky gut as indicated by positive lactulose-to-mannitol excretion ratio.
      With blood bacteriome, the patients with critical phase (more severe dengue; n = 
      23) demonstrated more predominant abundance in Bacteroidetes and Escherichia spp.
      with the lower Bifidobacteria when compared with the healthy control (n = 5).
      Meanwhile, most of the blood bacteriome results in dengue with febrile stage (n =
      8) were comparable to the control, except for the lower Bifidobacteria in dengue 
      cases. Additionally, endotoxemia at the enrollment was demonstrated in five
      (62.5%) and 19 (82.6%) patients with febrile and critical phases, respectively,
      while serum BG was detectable in two (25%) and 20 (87%) patients with febrile and
      critical phases, respectively. There were higher peripheral blood non-classical
      monocytes and natural killer cells (NK cells) at the enrollment in patients with 
      febrile phage than in the cases with critical stage. Then, non-classical
      monocytes (CD14(-)CD16(+)) and NK cells (CD56(+)CD16(-)) increased at 4 and 7
      days of illness in the cases with critical and febrile stages, respectively, the 
      elevation of LPS and/or BG in serum on day 7 was also associated with the
      increase in monocytes, NK cells, and cytotoxic T cells. In summary, enhanced
      Proteobacteria (pathogenic bacteria from blood bacteriomes) along with increased 
      endotoxemia and serum BG (leaky gut syndrome) might be collaborated with the
      impaired microbial control (lower non-classical monocytes and NK cells) in the
      critical cases and causing more severe disease of dengue infection.

TI  - Heterogeneity in IgG-CD16 signaling in infectious disease outcomes.
PG  - 64-74
LID - 10.1111/imr.13109 [doi]
AB  - In this review, we discuss how IgG antibodies can modulate inflammatory signaling
      during viral infections with a focus on CD16a-mediated functions. We describe the
      structural heterogeneity of IgG antibody ligands, including subclass and
      glycosylation that impact binding by and downstream activity of CD16a, as well as
      the heterogeneity of CD16a itself, including allele and expression density. While
      inflammation is a mechanism required for immune homeostasis and resolution of
      acute infections, we focus here on two infectious diseases that are driven by
      pathogenic inflammatory responses during infection. Specifically, we review and
      discuss the evolving body of literature showing that afucosylated IgG immune
      complex signaling through CD16a contributes to the overwhelming inflammatory
      response that is central to the pathogenesis of severe forms of dengue disease
      and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

LID - e78589 [pii]
AB  - T cells play a critical role in the adaptive immune response, recognizing peptide
      antigens presented on the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
      proteins. While assessing peptides for MHC binding is an important component of
      probing these interactions, traditional assays for testing peptides of interest
      for MHC binding are limited in throughput. Here, we present a yeast display-based
      platform for assessing the binding of tens of thousands of user-defined peptides 
      in a high-throughput manner. We apply this approach to assess a tiled library
      covering the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and four dengue virus serotypes for binding to
      human class II MHCs, including HLA-DR401, -DR402, and -DR404. While the peptide
      datasets show broad agreement with previously described MHC-binding motifs, they 
      additionally reveal experimentally validated computational false positives and
      false negatives. We therefore present this approach as able to complement current
      experimental datasets and computational predictions. Further, our yeast display
      approach underlines design considerations for epitope identification experiments 
      and serves as a framework for examining relationships between viral conservation 
      and MHC binding, which can be used to identify potentially high-interest peptide 
      binders from viral proteins. These results demonstrate the utility of our
      approach to determine peptide-MHC binding interactions in a manner that can
      supplement and potentially enhance current algorithm-based approaches.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Carica papaya L., a common fruit crop of the
      family Caricaceae and its leaf juice/extract is a traditionally commended
      preparation against dengue and other thrombocytopenic diseases by many Asian
      countries. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study posits the potential cellular
      mechanisms of platelet augmentation activity of mature leaf juice of Sri Lankan
      wild-type Carica papaya. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C. papaya leaf juice prepared
      from different cultivar types, maturity of the leaf, agro-climatic region, and
      preparation methods were orally administered to hydroxyurea-induced
      thrombocytopenic rats at 0.72 ml/100 g BW dosage to investigate the most potent
      platelet increasing preparation. The papaya juice doses; low dose (LD-0.18 ml/100
      g BW), human equivalent dose (HED-0.36 ml/100 g BW), and high dose (HD-0.72
      ml/100 g BW), were administered to thrombocytopenic rats (N = 6/group) daily for 
      three consecutive days and post-treatment plasma levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), 
      thrombopoietin (TPO), and platelet-activating factor (PAF) were quantified using 
      specific rat ELISA kits. The mature leaf juice of C. papaya induced IL-6
      secretion from bone marrow cell (BMC) cultures was quantified using ELISA. The
      ability of papaya juice to protect the platelet membrane, from the damage caused 
      by the lytic agent was analyzed in vitro using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
      assay. The effect of the mature leaf juice of C. papaya on secondary hemostasis
      was investigated using blood coagulation and clot hydrolyzing activity. RESULTS: 
      The comparative analysis revealed that the platelet increasing activity of C.
      papaya leaf did not significantly differ among different types of cultivar,
      maturity of the leaf, agro-climatic regions and preparation methods (p > 0.05).
      Both TPO and PAF levels in thrombocytopenic rats diminished when treated with all
      three doses of the mature leaf juice of C. papaya (p < 0.05), yet IL-6 plasma
      level was unaltered (p > 0.05). Nevertheless, ex vivo treatment of the mature
      leaf juice of C. papaya had significantly enhanced IL-6 levels of rat BMC
      cultures (p < 0.05). Pre-treatment of platelets with the mature leaf juice of C. 
      papaya at different concentrations significantly inhibited LDH leakage from
      platelets and may have reduced the membrane damage caused by the lytic agent (p <
      0.05). Treatment of mature leaf juice of C. papaya also significantly reduced
      blood clotting time through the extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation
      cascade (p < 0.05). Further, prolonged incubation of the plasma clot with
      different concentrations of the papaya leaf juice revealed dose-dependent
      hydrolysis of the blood clot, indicating fibrinolysis activity. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      current study exceeded the traditional medicinal claims, and scientifically
      affirmed the platelet augmentation activity of mature leaf juice of C. papaya.
      The mechanistic rationale tested herein explicated that the platelet augmentation
      activity of the papaya leaf juice can be partially attributed to the stimulation 
      of bone marrow megakaryocytes via modulating thrombopoietic cytokines TPO and
      IL-6, and by inhibiting the secretion of PAF, while reducing the peripheral
      platelet destruction by stabilizing the platelet membrane. Further, mature leaf
      juice of C. papaya imparted both pro-coagulation and fibrinolysis activity of
      secondary hemostasis endorsing its potential against thrombocytopenia.

TI  - Clinical Profile and Lab Findings of Dengue Fever in Children Admitted in a
      Tertiary Care Hospital.
PG  - 741-748
AB  - Dengue is an arboviral infection dengue virus (DENV 1-4) transmitted by Aedes
      mosquito. It shows a wide range of clinical presentation from asymptomatic cases 
      to undifferentiated fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock
      syndrome (DSS) or non-severe and severe dengue. Most cases of dengue are
      self-limiting; however, severe dengue has high mortality if not diagnosed and
      managed early during the disease. Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a serious
      global public health challenge resulting approximately 200 million cases of
      morbidity and 50,000 cases of mortality annually. Management is based on clinical
      and lab parameters with certain lab tests aiding in the early forecast of severe 
      dengue. While serological tests (detection of nonstructural protein 1 [NS1]
      antigen, immunoglobulin IgM and IgG antibodies aid in diagnosis of dengue,
      simple, cost-effective, easy tests such as hematocrit and platelet counts have
      great utility in resource-poor healthcare systems for predicting onset of severe 
      dengue. To determine the clinical profile and lab findings of different varieties
      of Dengue fever in children admitted in a tertiary care hospital. This
      retrospective observational study was designed to collect data from the medical
      records of children of both sexes, aged up to 12 years old. The study was
      conducted from April 2019 to September 2019 in pediatrics department of BSMMU,
      Dhaka. A total of 50 children who were admitted with the complaints of fever and 
      were found positive for either NS1 antigen or dengue IgM or IgG antibodies were
      included in the study. Patients with chronic diseases or any concurrent
      infections were excluded. Samples were collected from hospital record and kept in
      a separate management system only for dengue patients. The demographics, clinical
      and laboratory findings were recorded via structured data collection sheet. Among
      50 cases, 22 were dengue fever, 17 were dengue hemorrhagic fever and 11 were
      dengue shock syndrome. The mean age of study participant was 6.95. Out of 50
      patients, Male 62.0% were predominant over the female 38.0% and majority 74.0%
      came from urban area. Fever (95.5%) was mostly the presenting feature in dengue
      fever. Bleeding (29.4%) and tourniquet test positive (47.0%) were most in DHF.
      Hypotension (90.0%), tachycardia (90.9%), edema (18.2%), shock (90.9%) and
      hepatomegaly (72.7%) were mostly present in DSS. Neutropenia (72.7%) was
      significant in DSS. Platelet count (32,588.24+/-22,335.67) was significantly low 
      in DHF. Albumin count (27.82+/-5.25) and TCO2 (18.27+/-1.8) were significantly
      low in DSS. Statistical analysis was done by Kuskalwallis test for categorical
      data analysis and one way ANOVA test for comparison of continuous data. P value
      <0.05 is considered as significant. This time it was seen that bleeding,
      tourniquet test positivity with low platelet count is seen in DHF. But DSS was
      marked by hepatomegaly and hypoalbuminaemia.

AB  - Dengue fever is caused by four related dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1 to DENV-4, 
      where each serotype comprises distinct genotypes and lineages. The last major
      outbreak in Mexico occurred during 2012 and 2013, when 112,698 confirmed cases
      were reported (DENV-1 and DENV-2 were predominant). Following partial E, NS2A and
      NS5 gene sequencing, based on the virus genome variability, we analyzed 396
      DENV-1 and 248 DENV-2 gene sequences from serum samples from dengue acute
      clinical cases from 13 Mexican states, Mutations were identified, and their
      genetic variability estimated, along with their evolutionary relationship with
      DENV sequences sampled globally. DENV-1 genotype V and DENV-2 Asian-American
      genotype V were the only genotypes circulating during the outbreak. Mutations in 
      NS2A and NS5 proteins were widely disseminated and suggested local emergence of
      new lineages. Phylogeographic analysis suggested viral spread occurred from
      coastal regions, and tourist destinations, such as Yucatan and Quintana Roo,
      which played important roles in disseminating these lineages.

TI  - A fatal case of dengue hemorrhagic fever associated with dengue virus 4 (DENV-4) 
      in Brazil: genomic and histopathological findings.
LID - 10.1007/s42770-022-00784-4 [doi]
AB  - Dengue infection is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease in
      subtropical and tropical regions, whose primary vector is Aedes aegypti
      mosquitoes. The mechanisms of dengue virus (DENV) pathogenesis are little
      understood because we have no good disease models. Only humans develop symptoms
      (dengue fever, DF, or dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF) and research has been
      limited to studies involving patients. Samples from serum, brain, cerebellum,
      heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys from a 13-year-old male patient that died with
      hemorrhagic manifestations were sent for differential diagnosis at Adolfo Lutz,
      using both classical virological methods (RT-qPCR, virus isolation, ELISA, and
      hemagglutination inhibition test) and immunohistochemistry (IHQ). A DENV serotype
      4 was detected by a DENV multiplex RT-qPCR, and the C6/36 cell supernatant was
      used for NGS using Minion. Lesions were described in the heart, liver, lung, and 
      kidney with positive IHQ in endothelial cells of the brain, cerebellum, heart,
      and kidney, and also in hepatocytes and Kuppfer cells. A whole genome was
      obtained, revealing a DENV-4 genotype II, with no evidence of secondary dengue
      infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The (re-)emergence of arboviruses in the Caribbean, and worldwide, is
      a major public health issue of concern to all scientific research stakeholders.
      This study aimed to use bibliometric analysis to identify the contribution of
      Caribbean countries to scientific production regarding the three arboviruses with
      the greatest impact, namely zika, chikungunya and dengue. METHOD: Bibliographic
      data related to arbovirus diseases were collected from three international
      databases (Web of Science, Pubmed, and Scopus), filtered by Caribbean islands of 
      affiliation. VosViewer was used to identify scientific connections between
      countries or institutions and to identify research themes. RESULTS: The dataset
      comprised 1332 indexed articles, with 50% of articles categorized in the top
      quartile of quality. Cuba was found to lead research on dengue, with a total of
      300 articles, and 18 international connections. The USA-Puerto Rico duo was found
      to be the leader on emerging arboviruses (Zika and Chikungunya), followed by a
      predominantly French-language cluster (mainland France, Guadeloupe, Martinique). 
      Key research topics were related to clinical presentations, epidemiology, and
      research on mosquito-borne viruses CONCLUSIONS: Co-authorship network analysis on
      emerging arboviruses revealed the dynamics of collaboration, and provides
      insights into Caribbean collaborations that deserve to be created and
      consolidated in case of resurgence of new arbovirus epidemics.

AB  - The host-seeking activity of hematophagous arthropods is essential for arboviral 
      transmission. Here, we demonstrate that mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses can
      manipulate host skin microbiota to produce a scent that attracts mosquitoes. We
      observed that Aedes mosquitoes preferred to seek and feed on mice infected by
      dengue and Zika viruses. Acetophenone, a volatile compound that is predominantly 
      produced by the skin microbiota, was enriched in the volatiles from the infected 
      hosts to potently stimulate mosquito olfaction for attractiveness. Of note,
      acetophenone emission was higher in dengue patients than in healthy people.
      Mechanistically, flaviviruses infection suppressed the expression of RELMalpha,
      an essential antimicrobial protein on host skin, thereby leading to the expansion
      of acetophenone-producing commensal bacteria and, consequently, a high
      acetophenone level. Given that RELMalpha can be specifically induced by a vitamin
      A derivative, the dietary administration of isotretinoin to flavivirus-infected
      animals interrupted flavivirus life cycle by reducing mosquito host-seeking
      activity, thus providing a strategy of arboviral control.

TI  - Small-scale field assessment against the dengue vector Aedes aegypti using the
      auto-dissemination approach in an urban area of Vientiane, Lao PDR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Lao PDR, dengue fever is the most important vector borne disease
      and vector control remains the principal method to fight against Aedes aegypti
      the primary transmitter mosquito species. Vector control management programs need
      new strategies in addition to conventional larviciding and adulticiding
      interventions in the country. In this study, we examined the In2Care(R) Mosquito 
      Trap's efficacy using insecticide auto-dissemination strategy. The insecticide
      pyriproxyfen, present in powder form inside the trap station, contaminates the
      body of gravid female mosquitoes visiting the traps and is later on disseminated 
      via the mosquitoes in breeding sites surrounding the traps. We tested the
      attractiveness of the Traps, their efficacy to reduce the larval and adult
      abundance, and the impact on emergence rates. Specifically, we tested if the
      servicing interval of the In2Care(R) Mosquito Trap could be extended to 12 weeks.
      METHODS: Two black plastic ovitrap buckets and two BG(R) sentinel traps were
      placed in the premises of the Science campus of Vientiane Capital located in an
      urban area to measure weekly the larval and adult relative abundance of Aedes
      mosquitoes from 2017 to 2019. Twenty-five In2Care(R) Mosquito Traps were evenly
      distributed in this area and two studies of 12 weeks were implemented during
      January and April 2018 and, July to October 2018 (dry and rainy season,
      respectively). Every 2 weeks, water samples from 5 In2Care(R) Traps were randomly
      selected and tested at the laboratory with Ae. aegypti larvae to measure the
      larval and pupal mortality. The relative abundance of Aedes mosquitoes in the BG 
      traps(R) with the presence of In2Care(R) Traps in 2018, was compared with the
      surveillance results obtained in 2017 and 2019 without In2Care(R) Traps. Every
      week, water samples from the ovitrap buckets were tested for Emergence Inhibition
      (EI). RESULTS: The In2Care(R) Traps were very attractive to gravid Ae. aegypti
      mosquitoes specifically during the rainy seasons with 96% of the traps colonized 
      with larvae/pupae within four weeks. The bioassays showed 100% mortality in the
      water samples from the traps during the twelve weeks studies showing the good
      efficacy over time of the pyriproxyfen without additional servicing in the 12
      week period. In addition, the larvicide was successfully disseminated into the
      ovitrap buckets placed in the treated area where 100% of EI during all weeks of
      intervention was measured. There was no significant effect of the treatment on
      adult abundance reduction in the treated area, probably due to recolonization of 
      adult mosquitoes surrounding the field experiment. CONCLUSIONS: The observed
      potential of the In2Care(R) Mosquito Trap using the auto-dissemination strategy
      could lead to the use of this new tool in combination with conventional control
      methods against Dengue vectors in urban tropical areas. Large scale field trials 
      should be implemented in Lao PDR to prove its efficacy for Public Health
      programs.

TI  - Partial masculinization of Aedes aegypti females by conditional expression of
      Nix.
PG  - e0010598
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010598 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue, yellow fever, and other
      arboviruses thrives in tropical and subtropical areas around the globe putting
      half of the world's population at risk. Despite aggressive efforts to control the
      transmission of those viruses, an unacceptable number of cases occur every year, 
      emphasizing the need to develop new control strategies. Proposals for vector
      control focused on population suppression could offer a feasible alternative
      method to reduce disease transmission. The induction of extreme male-biased sex
      ratios has been hypothesized to be able to suppress or collapse a population,
      with previous experiments showing that stable expression of the male determining 
      factor Nix in A. aegypti is sufficient to convert females into fertile males.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report on the conditional expression of 
      Nix in transgenic A. aegypti under the control of the tetracycline-dependent
      (Tet-off) system, with the goal of establishing repressible sex distortion. A
      masculinization phenotype was observed in three of the seven transgenic lines
      with females exhibiting male-like long maxillary palps and most importantly, the 
      masculinized females were unable to blood feed. Doxycycline treatment of the
      transgenic lines only partially restored the normal phenotype from the
      masculinized transgenic lines, while RT-qPCR analysis of early embryos or adults 
      showed no correlation between the level of masculinization and ectopic Nix
      expression. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: While the conditional expression of Nix
      produced intersex phenotypes, the level of expression was insufficient to program
      full conversion. Modifications that increase both the level of activation (no
      tet) and the level of repression (with tet) will be necessary, as such this study
      represents one step forward in the development of genetic strategies to control
      vector-borne diseases via sex ratio distortion.

PG  - e0010537
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010537 [doi]
AB  - The current study elucidated an association between gene variants and
      thrombocytopenia through the investigation of the exonic polymorphic landscape of
      hematopoietic transcription factor-GATA1 gene in dengue patients. A total of 115 
      unrelated dengue patients with dengue fever (DF) (N = 91) and dengue hemorrhagic 
      fever (DHF) (N = 24) were included in the study. All dengue patients were
      confirmed through detection of NS1 antigen, IgM, and IgG antibodies against the
      dengue virus. Polymerase chain reaction using specific primers amplified the
      exonic regions of GATA1 while Sanger sequencing and chromatogram analyses
      facilitated the identification of variants. Variants G>A (at chX: 48792009) and
      C>A (at chX: 4879118) had higher frequency out of 13 variants identified (3
      annotated and 10 newly recognized). Patients carrying either nonsynonymous or
      synonymous variants had significantly lower mean values of platelets compared to 
      those harboring the reference nucleotides (NC_000023.11). Further analyses
      revealed that the change in amino acid residue leads to the altered
      three-dimensional structure followed by interaction with neighboring residues.
      Increased stability of the protein due to substitution of serine by asparagine
      (S129N at chX: 48792009) may cause increased rigidity followed by reduced
      structural flexibility which may ultimately disturb the dimerization (an
      important prerequisite for GATA1 to perform its biological activity) process of
      the GATA1 protein. This, in turn, may affect the function of GATA1 followed by
      impaired production of mature platelets which may be reflected by the lower
      platelet counts in individuals with such variation. In summary, we have
      identified new variants within the GATA1 gene which were found to be clinically
      relevant to the outcome of dengue patients and thus, have the potential as
      candidate biomarkers for the determination of severity and prognosis of
      thrombocytopenia caused by dengue virus. However, further validation of this
      study in a large number of dengue patients is warranted. Trial Registration:

TI  - The effect of weather and climate on dengue outbreak risk in Peru, 2000-2018: A
      time-series analysis.
PG  - e0010479
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010479 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is the most common arboviral disease in humans, with an 
      estimated 50-100 million annual infections worldwide. Dengue fever cases have
      increased substantially in the past four decades, driven largely by anthropogenic
      factors including climate change. More than half the population of Peru is at
      risk of dengue infection and due to its geography, Peru is also particularly
      sensitive to the effects of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Determining the 
      effect of ENSO on the risk for dengue outbreaks is of particular public health
      relevance and may also be applicable to other Aedes-vectored viruses. METHODS: We
      conducted a time-series analysis at the level of the district-month, using
      surveillance data collected from January 2000 to September 2018 from all
      districts with a mean elevation suitable to survival of the mosquito vector
      (<2,500m), and ENSO and weather data from publicly-available datasets maintained 
      by national and international agencies. We took a Bayesian hierarchical modeling 
      approach to address correlation in space, and B-splines with four knots per year 
      to address correlation in time. We furthermore conducted subgroup analyses by
      season and natural region. RESULTS: We detected a positive and significant effect
      of temperature ( degrees C, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.13, 1.15, adjusted for
      precipitation) and ENSO (ICEN index: RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.15, 1.20; ONI index: RR
      1.04, 95% CI 1.02, 1.07) on outbreak risk, but no evidence of a strong effect for
      precipitation after adjustment for temperature. Both natural region and season
      were found to be significant effect modifiers of the ENSO-dengue effect, with the
      effect of ENSO being stronger in the summer and the Selva Alta and Costa regions,
      compared with winter and Selva Baja and Sierra regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      provide strong evidence that temperature and ENSO have significant effects on
      dengue outbreaks in Peru, however these results interact with region and season, 
      and are stronger for local ENSO impacts than remote ENSO impacts. These findings 
      support optimization of a dengue early warning system based on local weather and 
      climate monitoring, including where and when to deploy such a system and
      parameterization of ENSO events, and provide high-precision effect estimates for 
      future climate and dengue modeling efforts.

AB  - In this review, we discuss the epidemiological dynamics of different viral
      infections to project how the transition from a pandemic to endemic Severe Acute 
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might take shape. Drawing from
      theories of disease invasion and transmission dynamics, waning immunity in the
      face of viral evolution and antigenic drift, and empirical data from influenza,
      dengue, and seasonal coronaviruses, we discuss the putative periodicity,
      severity, and age dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 as it becomes endemic. We review recent 
      studies on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, immunology, and evolution that are
      particularly useful in projecting the transition to endemicity and highlight gaps
      that warrant further research.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in differentiating tropical infections: A step ahead.
PG  - e0010455
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010455 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Differentiating tropical infections are difficult due
      to its homogenous nature of clinical and laboratorial presentations among them.
      Sophisticated differential tests and prediction tools are better ways to tackle
      this issue. Here, we aimed to develop a clinician assisted decision making tool
      to differentiate the common tropical infections. METHODOLOGY: A cross sectional
      study through 9 item self-administered questionnaire were performed to understand
      the need of developing a decision making tool and its parameters. The most
      significant differential parameters among the identified infections were measured
      through a retrospective study and decision tree was developed. Based on the
      parameters identified, a multinomial logistic regression model and a machine
      learning model were developed which could better differentiate the infection.
      RESULTS: A total of 40 physicians involved in the management of tropical
      infections were included for need analysis. Dengue, malaria, leptospirosis and
      scrub typhus were the common tropical infections in our settings. Sodium, total
      bilirubin, albumin, lymphocytes and platelets were the laboratory parameters; and
      abdominal pain, arthralgia, myalgia and urine output were the clinical
      presentation identified as better predictors. In multinomial logistic regression 
      analysis with dengue as a reference revealed a predictability of 60.7%, 62.5% and
      66% for dengue, malaria and leptospirosis, respectively, whereas, scrub typhus
      showed only 38% of predictability. The multi classification machine learning
      model observed to have an overall predictability of 55-60%, whereas a binary
      classification machine learning algorithms showed an average of 79-84% for one vs
      other and 69-88% for one vs one disease category. CONCLUSION: This is a first of 
      its kind study where both statistical and machine learning approaches were
      explored simultaneously for differentiating tropical infections. Machine learning
      techniques in healthcare sectors will aid in early detection and better patient
      care.

AB  - An effective dengue vaccine should ideally induce broadly neutralizing antibody
      (nAb) responses against all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. We characterized 
      the specificity and breadth of the nAb response to TAK-003, a live attenuated
      tetravalent dengue vaccine, in serum samples from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. 
      Microneutralization tests using post-vaccination serum showed comparable
      neutralization against diverse DENV-1-4 genotypes. Reporter virus particle
      neutralization assays post- depletion of anti-DENV-2 nAbs demonstrated that the
      nAb response to DENV-1, -3 and -4 comprises both type-specific (TS) and
      cross-reactive (CR) nAbs. Therefore, TAK-003 induces broad tetravalent TS and CR 
      nAb responses.

TI  - Distribution Expansion of Dengue Vectors and Climate Change in India.
PG  - e2021GH000477
LID - 10.1029/2021GH000477 [doi]
AB  - India has witnessed a five-fold increase in dengue incidence in the past decade. 
      However, the nation-wide distribution of dengue vectors, and the impacts of
      climate change are not known. In this study, species distribution modeling was
      used to predict the baseline and future distribution of Aedine vectors in India
      on the basis of biologically relevant climatic indicators. Known occurrences of
      Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus were obtained from the Global Biodiversity
      Information Facility database and previous literature. Bio-climatic variables
      were used as the potential predictors of vector distribution. After eliminating
      collinear and low contributing predictors, the baseline and future prevalence of 
      Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus was determined, under three Representative
      Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), using the MaxEnt 
      species distribution model. Aedes aegypti was found prevalent in most parts of
      the southern peninsula, the eastern coastline, north eastern states and the
      northern plains. In contrast, Aedes albopictus has localized distribution along
      the eastern and western coastlines, north eastern states and in the lower
      Himalayas. Under future scenarios of climate change, Aedes aegypti is projected
      to expand into unsuitable regions of the Thar desert, whereas Aedes albopictus is
      projected to expand to the upper and trans Himalaya regions of the north.
      Overall, the results provide a reliable assessment of vectors prevalence in most 
      parts of the country that can be used to guide surveillance efforts, despite
      minor disagreements with dengue incidence in Rajasthan and the north east,
      possibly due to behavioral practices and sampling efforts.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 on essential health service provision for endemic
      infectious diseases in the South-East Asia region: A systematic review.
PG  - 100011
LID - 10.1016/j.lansea.2022.04.007 [doi]
AB  - Background: There is increasing evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted 
      adversely on the provision of essential health services. The South East Asia
      region (SEAR) has experienced extremely high rates of COVID-19 infection, and
      continues to bear a significant proportion of communicable disease burden
      worldwide. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of quantitative
      evidence to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the provision of essential
      prevention, detection, treatment, and management services for five high-burden
      infectious diseases across the SEAR. Findings: A total of 2338 studies were
      reviewed, and 12 studies were included in our analysis, covering six countries
      across the SEAR (Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, and India) for
      three conditions of interest (HIV, TB, dengue fever). We identified significant
      disruption to TB testing (range=25% to 77.9%) and diagnoses (range=50% to 58%) in
      India, Nepal, and Indonesia; and similar disruptions were observed for screening,
      new diagnoses and commencing HIV treatment in India and Thailand. There was also 
      drastically reduced case detection for dengue fever (range=75% to 90% disrupted) 
      in Bhutan and Sri Lanka. No studies were identified for malaria nor hepatitis in 
      any country, and nor for any service in the remaining six SEAR countries.
      Interpretation: We identified evidence of significant disruption to the
      prevention, diagnoses, treatment, and management of TB, HIV, and dengue fever due
      to the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple SEAR country settings. This has the
      potential to set back hard-fought gains in infectious disease control across the 
      region. The lack of evidence for the impact of the pandemic on malaria and
      hepatitis services, and in the remaining six SEAR countries, is an important
      evidence gap that should be addressed in order to inform future policy for
      service protection and pandemic preparedness. Funding: This work was supported by
      the WHO Sri Lanka Country office.

AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral illness that infects humans. For the past few
      decades, it has been declared a global public health problem. The current study, 
      conducted at the district headquarter hospital (DHQ) Bannu between June to
      September 2018, was based on the seroprevalence of antibodies against dengue
      virus serotypes and their hematological parameters among the patients. A total of
      1738 individuals suspected of having dengue were diagnosed through NS1, IgG, and 
      IgM antibodies and RT-PCR techniques. Of all the samples, 716 (41.19%) were found
      to be positive for dengue. A higher infection rate was found in males (65.92%)
      compared with females (34.07%). The most affected age group was 16-40 years,
      whereas the most affected tehsil was Bannu, where the DENV-3 serotype was
      prevalent. The rare serotype (DENV-4) was found in 1% of cases. Symptoms
      including fever (100%), myalgia (100%), headache (61.31%), vomiting (34.63%), and
      rashes were common among the dengue patients. However, the mild cases showed
      fewer clinical signs compared with the severely infected cases. The study also
      revealed a significant association (P < 0.05) between hematological parameters
      and dengue infection, showing a significant decrease in TC, eosinophils,
      neutrophils, and platelets and a significant increase in monocytes and
      lymphocytes. Based on the current report, it is concluded that patients with the 
      above symptoms and hematological changes may have an increased probability of
      dengue and should be kept under observation to separate dengue-positive patients 
      and to enhance the treatment process.

AB  - Worldwide, vector-transmitted diseases account for more than 17% of all
      infectious diseases and cause more than 700,000 deaths annually. The primary
      strategy to control the transmission of dengue, chikungunya and Zika focuses on
      the control of their vectors. Vector control programs depend mainly on the use of
      insecticides. However, these measures have failed to yield the desired results
      because the lack of proper control decreases their effectiveness over time. Also,
      the effect of insecticide use on non-target organisms, environmental
      contamination, and the development of insecticide resistance impose continuous
      challenges for insecticide-dependant control programs. The sterile insect
      technique, on the other hand, is a non-polluting and environment-friendly
      technique. The use of sterile insects is generally well established in
      agriculture, but human health interventions often require a consensus that
      combines social perceptions with scientific evidence. Factors associated with
      acceptance of the releases of sterile male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were assessed
      with logistic regression models for two communities (Rio Florido and Hidalgo) in 
      Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico. The favourable opinion of the respondents about the
      project workers, and the fact that the releases of sterile mosquitoes would be
      managed by the Secretaria de Salud, were found to be factors that supported the
      acceptance of sterile mosquito releases. Factors associated with disapproval were
      community (Rio Florido and Hidalgo) and the misbelief that sterile male
      mosquitoes can bite. The differences observed between the communities included in
      this study might be the result of experiences with the releases, of social and
      community organisation, and of leadership by social actors.

      symptomatic dengue virus type 3 infection.
PG  - eabm3151
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.abm3151 [doi]
AB  - Preexisting cross-reactive antibodies have been implicated in both protection and
      pathogenesis during subsequent infections with different dengue virus (DENV)
      serotypes (DENV1-4). Nonetheless, humoral immune correlates and mechanisms of
      protection have remained elusive. Using a systems serology approach to evaluate
      humoral responses, we profiled plasma collected before inapparent or symptomatic 
      secondary DENV3 infection from our pediatric cohort in Nicaragua. Children
      protected from symptomatic infections had more anti-envelope (E) and
      anti-nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) total immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG4, and
      greater Fc effector functions than those with symptoms. Fc effector functions
      were also associated with protection from hemorrhagic manifestations in the
      pre-symptomatic group. Furthermore, in vitro virological assays using these
      plasma samples revealed that protection mediated by antibody-dependent complement
      deposition was associated with both lysis of virions and DENV-infected cells.
      These data suggest that E- and NS1-specific Fc functions may serve as correlates 
      of protection, which can be potentially applied toward the design and evaluation 
      of dengue vaccines.

TI  - Cytokines, CXCL10 and CCL2 and kynurenine metabolites, anthranilic acid
      accurately predicts patients at risk of developing Dengue with Warning Signs.
LID - jiac273 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac273 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The resolution or aggravation of dengue infection depends on the
      patient's immune response during the critical phase. Cytokines released by immune
      cells increase with the worsening severity of dengue infections. Cytokines
      activate the kynurenine pathway (KP) and the extent of KP activation then
      influences disease severity. METHODS: KP metabolites and cytokines in plasma
      samples of patients with dengue infections (DWS-, DWS+ or SD) were analysed.
      Cytokines (IFN-, TNF, IL-6, CXCL10/IP-10, IL-18, CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL4/MIP-1beta)
      were assessed by a Human Luminex Screening Assay, while KP metabolites
      (tryptophan, kynurenine, anthranilic acid, picolinic acid and quinolinic acid) by
      uHPLC and GCMS assays. RESULTS: Patients with DWS+ had increased activation of
      the KP where kynurenine-tryptophan ratio, anthranilic acid and picolinic acid
      were elevated. These patients also had higher levels of cytokines, IFN-, CXCL10, 
      CCL4 and IL-18 than those with DWS-. Further ROC analysis identified three
      prognostic biomarker candidates, CXCL10, CCL2 and AA which predicted patients
      with higher risks of developing DWS+ with an accuracy of 97%. CONCLUSION: The
      data suggest a unique biochemical signature in patients with DWS+. CXCL10 and
      CCL2 together with AA are potential prognostic biomarkers that discern patients
      with higher risks of developing DWS+ at earlier stages of infection.

TI  - Sec61 Inhibitor Apratoxin S4 Potently Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and Exhibits
      Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Activity.
PG  - 1265-1279
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.2c00008 [doi]
AB  - There is a pressing need for host-directed therapeutics that elicit
      broad-spectrum antiviral activities to potentially address current and future
      viral pandemics. Apratoxin S4 (Apra S4) is a potent Sec61 inhibitor that prevents
      cotranslational translocation of secretory proteins into the endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER), leading to anticancer and antiangiogenic activity both in vitro
      and in vivo. Since Sec61 has been shown to be an essential host factor for viral 
      proteostasis, we tested Apra S4 in cellular models of viral infection, including 
      SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, and flaviviruses (Zika, West Nile, and Dengue
      virus). Apra S4 inhibited viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner
      and had high potency particularly against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus, with 
      subnanomolar activity in human cells. Characterization studies focused on
      SARS-CoV-2 revealed that Apra S4 impacted a post-entry stage of the viral
      life-cycle. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that Apra S4 blocked
      formation of stacked double-membrane vesicles, the sites of viral replication.
      Apra S4 reduced dsRNA formation and prevented viral protein production and
      trafficking of secretory proteins, especially the spike protein. Given the potent
      and broad-spectrum activity of Apra S4, further preclinical evaluation of Apra S4
      and other Sec61 inhibitors as antivirals is warranted.

TI  - Dynamic immune ecosystem of dengue infection revealed by single-cell sequencing.
LID - 10.1002/JLB.6MA0622-738RR [doi]
AB  - Dengue is the most common human arboviral disease worldwide, which can result in 
      severe complications. A dysfunctional immune response in dengue infective
      patients is a recurrent theme impacting symptoms and mortality, but the
      heterogeneity and dynamics of immune infiltrates during dengue infection remain
      poorly characterized. Here, we identified the immune cell types in scRNA-seq data
      from 13127 cells of 10 dengue infective patients and discovered the dynamic
      immune ecosystems of dengue infection. Notably, genes that exhibited higher
      expression in specific cell types play important roles in response to virus
      infection in a module manner. Transcription factors (TFs) are the major
      regulators (i.e., PAX5, IRF7, KLF4, and IRF8) that can potentially regulate
      infection-related genes. We demonstrated that the dynamic rewired regulatory
      network during dengue infection. Moreover, our data revealed the complex
      cell-cell communications from control to fever and severe dengue patients and
      prevalent cell-cell communication rewiring was observed. We further identified
      the IFN-II and CXCL signaling pathways that medicated the communications and play
      important roles in dengue infection. Together, our comprehensive analysis of
      dynamic immune ecosystem of dengue infection provided novel insights for
      understanding the pathogenesis of and developing effective therapeutic strategies
      for dengue infection.

TI  - Control and Anticontrol of chaos in Fractional-order models of Diabetes, HIV,
      Dengue, Migraine, Parkinson's and Ebola Virus diseases.
LID - 111419 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2021.111419 [doi]
AB  - This work proposes new fractional-order (FO) models of six chaotic diseases whose
      fractional dynamics have not been studied so far in literature. Secondly, design 
      and analysis of suitable controllers to control chaos where present, and that of 
      anticontrollers to generate chaos where absent, for these newly proposed FO
      models of diseases, are put forward. The proposed controllers and anticontrollers
      address the problem of the health hazards arising from the dysfunctionalities due
      to the impact of chaos in these biological models. Controllers to supress chaos
      in four diseases, namely, FO Diabetes Mellitus, FO Human Immunodeficiency Virus
      (HIV), FO Ebola Virus and FO Dengue models are designed by Back-stepping,
      Adaptive Feedback and Sliding Mode Control strategies, whereas anticontrollers to
      introduce chaos in diseases, namely, FO Parkinson's illness and FO Migraine
      models, are carried out by Linear State Feedback, Single State Sinusoidal
      Feedback and Sliding Mode Anticontrol strategies. The equilibrium points,
      eigenvalues and Lyapunov Exponents of the FO disease models are evaluated and
      indicate the significance of chaos in them and necessitate upon the requirement
      of controllers and anticontrollers accordingly. The simulation results in terms
      of bifurcation diagrams, time series plots and phase portraits confirm the
      successful accomplishment of the control objectives.

TI  - Forecasting new diseases in low-data settings using transfer learning.
PG  - 112306
LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2022.112306 [doi]
AB  - Recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Zika
      epidemic in Brazil, have demonstrated both the importance and difficulty of
      accurately forecasting novel infectious diseases. When new diseases first emerge,
      we have little knowledge of the transmission process, the level and duration of
      immunity to reinfection, or other parameters required to build realistic
      epidemiological models. Time series forecasts and machine learning, while less
      reliant on assumptions about the disease, require large amounts of data that are 
      also not available in early stages of an outbreak. In this study, we examine how 
      knowledge of related diseases can help make predictions of new diseases in
      data-scarce environments using transfer learning. We implement both an empirical 
      and a synthetic approach. Using data from Brazil, we compare how well different
      machine learning models transfer knowledge between two different dataset pairs:
      case counts of (i) dengue and Zika, and (ii) influenza and COVID-19. In the
      synthetic analysis, we generate data with an SIR model using different
      transmission and recovery rates, and then compare the effectiveness of different 
      transfer learning methods. We find that transfer learning offers the potential to
      improve predictions, even beyond a model based on data from the target disease,
      though the appropriate source disease must be chosen carefully. While imperfect, 
      these models offer an additional input for decision makers for pandemic response.

TI  - Etiology of acute febrile illnesses in Southern China: Findings from a two-year
      sentinel surveillance project, 2017-2019.
PG  - e0270586

AB  - BACKGROUND: Southern China is at risk for arborvirus disease transmission,
      including Zika virus and dengue. Patients often present to clinical care with
      non-specific acute febrile illnesses (AFI). To better describe the etiology of
      AFI, we implemented a two-year AFI surveillance project at five sentinel
      hospitals in Yunnan and Guangdong Provinces. METHODS: Between June 2017 and
      August 2019, we enrolled patients between 2 and 65 years of age presenting at one
      sentinel hospital in Mengla County, Yunnan, and four in Jiangmen City, Guangdong,
      with symptoms of AFI (acute onset of fever >/= 37.5 degrees C within the past 7
      days) without respiratory symptoms or diarrhea. Demographic, epidemiologic, and
      clinical information was obtained and entered into a web-based AFI surveillance
      database. A custom TaqMan Array card (TAC) was used to test patients' whole blood
      specimens for 27 different pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction
      assays. RESULTS: During the two-year project period, 836 patients were enrolled; 
      443 patients from Mengla County and 393 patients from Jiangmen City. The median
      age was 33 years [range: 2-65], and most were hospitalized [641, 77%]. Of 796
      patients with valid TAC results, 341 (43%) were positive for at least one of the 
      10 unique pathogens detected. This included 205 (26%) patients positive for
      dengue virus, 60 (8%) for Orientia tsutsugamushi, and 42 (5%) for Coxiella
      burnetii. Ten patients (1%) in Jiangmen City tested positive for malaria, 8 of
      whom reported recent travel outside of China. TAC results were negative for 455
      (57%) patients. None of the patients had a positive TAC detection for Zika virus.
      CONCLUSIONS: The project detected variability in the etiology of AFI in Southern 
      China and highlighted the importance of differential diagnosis. Dengue, O.
      tsutsugamushi, and C. burnetii were the most frequently identified pathogens
      among enrolled AFI patients. As a non-notifiable disease, the frequent detection 
      of C. burnetii is noteworthy and warrants additional investigation. The project
      provided a framework for routine surveillance for persons presenting with AFI.

TI  - Risk factors for mortality in patients with dengue: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1111/tmi.13797 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors for mortality in dengue. METHODS: We
      performed a systematic review and meta-analysis searching MEDLINE, Embase,
      SciELO, LILACS Bireme, and OpenGrey databases to identify eligible observational 
      studies of patients with dengue, of both genders, aged 14 years or older, that
      analysed risk factors associated with mortality and reported adjusted risk
      measures with their respective confidence intervals (CIs). We estimated the
      pooled weighted mean difference and 95% CIs with a DerSimonian and Laird
      random-effects model. We assessed the methodological quality using the
      Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Of 1,170 citations reviewed, 18 papers, with a
      total of 25,851 patients, were included in the systematic review and 12 in the
      meta-analysis. Severe hepatitis (OR 29.222, 95% CI 3.876-220.314), dengue shock
      syndrome (OR 23.575, 95% CI 3.664-151.702), altered mental status (OR 3.76, 95%
      CI 1.67-8.42), diabetes mellitus (OR 3.698, 95% CI 1.196-11.433), and higher
      pulse rate (OR 1.039, 95% CI 1.011-1.067) are associated with mortality in
      patients with dengue. All studies included were classified as having a high
      quality. CONCLUSIONS: Proper identification and management of these risk factors 
      should be considered to improve patient outcomes and reduce the hidden burden of 
      this neglected tropical disease. Future well-designed studies are needed to
      investigate the association of other clinical, radiological, and laboratorial
      findings with mortality in dengue, as well as to develop prognostic models based 
      on the risk factors found in our study.

TI  - Expression of fatty acid synthase genes and their role in development and
      arboviral infection of Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 233
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05336-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatty acids are the building blocks of complex lipids essential for
      living organisms. In mosquitoes, fatty acids are involved in cell membrane
      production, energy conservation and expenditure, innate immunity, development and
      reproduction. Fatty acids are synthesized by a multifunctional enzyme complex
      called fatty acid synthase (FAS). Several paralogues of FAS were found in the
      Aedes aegypti mosquito. However, the molecular characteristics and expression of 
      some of these paralogues have not been investigated. METHODS: Genome assemblies
      of Ae. aegypti were analyzed, and orthologues of human FAS was identified.
      Phylogenetic analysis and in silico molecular characterization were performed to 
      identify the functional domains of the Ae. aegypti FAS (AaFAS). Quantitative
      analysis and loss-of-function experiments were performed to determine the
      significance of different AaFAS transcripts in various stages of development,
      expression following different diets and the impact of AaFAS on dengue virus,
      serotype 2 (DENV2) infection and transmission. RESULTS: We identified seven
      putative FAS genes in the Ae. aegypti genome assembly, based on nucleotide
      similarity to the FAS proteins (tBLASTn) of humans, other mosquitoes and
      invertebrates. Bioinformatics and molecular analyses suggested that only five of 
      the AaFAS genes produce mRNA and therefore represent complete gene models.
      Expression levels of AaFAS varied among developmental stages and between male and
      female Ae. aegypti. Quantitative analyses revealed that expression of AaFAS1, the
      putative orthologue of the human FAS, was highest in adult females. Transient
      knockdown (KD) of AaFAS1 did not induce a complete compensation by other AaFAS
      genes but limited DENV2 infection of Aag2 cells in culture and the midgut of the 
      mosquito. CONCLUSION: AaFAS1 is the predominant AaFAS in adult mosquitoes. It has
      the highest amino acid similarity to human FAS and contains all enzymatic domains
      typical of human FAS. AaFAS1 also facilitated DENV2 replication in both cell
      culture and in mosquito midguts. Our data suggest that AaFAS1 may play a role in 
      transmission of dengue viruses and could represent a target for intervention
      strategies.

TI  - An ensemble forecast system for tracking dynamics of dengue outbreaks and its
      validation in China.
PG  - e1010218
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010218 [doi]
AB  - As a common vector-borne disease, dengue fever remains challenging to predict due
      to large variations in epidemic size across seasons driven by a number of factors
      including population susceptibility, mosquito density, meteorological conditions,
      geographical factors, and human mobility. An ensemble forecast system for dengue 
      fever is first proposed that addresses the difficulty of predicting outbreaks
      with drastically different scales. The ensemble forecast system based on a
      susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) type of compartmental model coupled with a
      data assimilation method called the ensemble adjusted Kalman filter (EAKF) is
      constructed to generate real-time forecasts of dengue fever spread dynamics. The 
      model was informed by meteorological and mosquito density information to depict
      the transmission of dengue virus among human and mosquito populations, and
      generate predictions. To account for the dramatic variations of outbreak size in 
      different seasons, the effective population size parameter that is sequentially
      updated to adjust the predicted outbreak scale is introduced into the model.
      Before optimizing the transmission model, we update the effective population size
      using the most recent observations and historical records so that the predicted
      outbreak size is dynamically adjusted. In the retrospective forecast of dengue
      outbreaks in Guangzhou, China during the 2011-2017 seasons, the proposed forecast
      model generates accurate projections of peak timing, peak intensity, and total
      incidence, outperforming a generalized additive model approach. The ensemble
      forecast system can be operated in real-time and inform control planning to
      reduce the burden of dengue fever.

AB  - Viral genomics has become crucial in clinical diagnostics and ecology, not to
      mention to stem the COVID-19 pandemic. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is pivotal
      in gaining an improved understanding of viral evolution, genomic epidemiology,
      infectious outbreaks, pathobiology, clinical management, and vaccine development.
      Genome assembly is one of the crucial steps in WGS data analyses. A series of
      different assemblers has been developed with the advent of high-throughput
      next-generation sequencing (NGS). Various studies have reported the evaluation of
      these assembly tools on distinct datasets; however, these lack data from viral
      origin. In this study, we performed a comparative evaluation and benchmarking of 
      eight de novo assemblers: SOAPdenovo, Velvet, assembly by short sequences
      (ABySS), iterative De Bruijn graph assembler (IDBA), SPAdes, Edena, iterative
      virus assembler, and VICUNA on the viral NGS data from distinct Illumina (GAIIx, 
      Hiseq, Miseq, and Nextseq) platforms. WGS data of diverse viruses, that is,
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), dengue virus 3,
      human immunodeficiency virus 1, hepatitis B virus, human herpesvirus 8, human
      papillomavirus 16, rhinovirus A, and West Nile virus, were utilized to assess
      these assemblers. Performance metrics such as genome fraction recovery, assembly 
      lengths, NG50, N50, contig length, contig numbers, mismatches, and misassemblies 
      were analyzed. Overall, three assemblers, that is, SPAdes, IDBA, and ABySS,
      performed consistently well, including for genome assembly of SARS-CoV-2. These
      assembly methods should be considered and recommended for future studies of
      viruses. The study also suggests that implementing two or more assembly
      approaches should be considered in viral NGS studies, especially in clinical
      settings. Taken together, the benchmarking of eight de novo genome assemblers
      reported in this study can inform future public health and ecology research
      concerning the viruses, the COVID-19 pandemic, and viral outbreaks.

AB  - Introduction: Although dengue is the most common arbovirus infection worldwide,
      studies of severe dengue in Africa are lacking, and risk factors for severe
      dengue have been insufficiently described. This study was conducted in the
      context of the 2016 dengue epidemic in Burkina Faso to determine the prevalence
      of severe dengue, identify factors associated with severe dengue, and perform
      mapping of dengue cases in the country's capital, Ouagadougou. Methods: This
      cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2015 to January 2017. Data were
      collected in 15 public and private health centres, and included sociodemographic,
      clinical and patient outcome variables. Dengue was diagnosed using SD Bioline
      Dengue Duo rapid diagnostic tests. Data were analysed using Epi-Info Version 7.
      Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of severe dengue. P<0.05 was 
      considered significant. Dengue case mapping was performed using Geographic
      Information System software (ArcGIS). Results: Of the 811 patients who tested
      positive for dengue, 609 (75%) had early dengue (AgNS1 positive) and 272 (33.5%) 
      had severe dengue. Patient age ranged from 1 to 83 years (median 30.5 years) and 
      393 (48.3%) were female. Renal failure (13.1%) and severe bleeding (10.6%) were
      the most common signs of severe dengue. Risk factors for severe dengue included
      age, male sex, haemoglobin S, diabetes, hypertension, and primary dengue. Dengue 
      cases were more concentrated in sectors located in the centre of the city and
      close to the health centres. Conclusion: Dengue is increasingly common in Africa 
      and factors associated with severity should be sought systematically as soon as a
      patient tests positive. Additional studies are needed to determine if the factors
      found to be associated with severity can be used to identify patients at risk for
      dengue-related complications, and to provide early and specialized management to 
      reduce morbidity and mortality related to dengue in Africa.

TI  - Multiplex Serology for Measurement of IgG Antibodies Against Eleven Infectious
      Diseases in a National Serosurvey: Haiti 2014-2015.
PG  - 897013
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.897013 [doi]
AB  - Background: Integrated surveillance for multiple diseases can be an efficient use
      of resources and advantageous for national public health programs. Detection of
      IgG antibodies typically indicates previous exposure to a pathogen but can
      potentially also serve to assess active infection status. Serological multiplex
      bead assays have recently been developed to simultaneously evaluate exposure to
      multiple antigenic targets. Haiti is an island nation in the Caribbean region
      with multiple endemic infectious diseases, many of which have a paucity of data
      for population-level prevalence or exposure. Methods: A nationwide serosurvey
      occurred in Haiti from December 2014 to February 2015. Filter paper blood samples
      (n = 4,438) were collected from participants in 117 locations and assayed for IgG
      antibodies on a multiplex bead assay containing 15 different antigens from 11
      pathogens: Plasmodium falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii, lymphatic filariasis
      roundworms, Strongyloides stercoralis, chikungunya virus, dengue virus, Chlamydia
      trachomatis, Treponema pallidum, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Entamoeba
      histolytica, and Cryptosporidium parvum. Results: Different proportions of the
      Haiti study population were IgG seropositive to the different targets, with
      antigens from T. gondii, C. parvum, dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and C.
      trachomatis showing the highest rates of seroprevalence. Antibody responses to T.
      pallidum and lymphatic filariasis were the lowest, with <5% of all samples IgG
      seropositive to antigens from these pathogens. Clear trends of increasing
      seropositivity and IgG levels with age were seen for all antigens except those
      from chikungunya virus and E. histolytica. Parametric models were able to
      estimate the rate of seroconversion and IgG acquisition per year for residents of
      Haiti. Conclusions: Multiplex serological assays can provide a wealth of
      information about population exposure to different infectious diseases. This
      current Haitian study included IgG targets for arboviral, parasitic, and
      bacterial infectious diseases representing multiple different modes of host
      transmission. Some of these infectious diseases had a paucity or complete absence
      of published serological studies in Haiti. Clear trends of disease burden with
      respect to age and location in Haiti can be used by national programs and
      partners for follow-up studies, resource allocation, and intervention planning.

TI  - Detection of Dengue Virus From Aedes aegypti (Diptera, Culicidae) in Field-Caught
      Samples From Makkah Al-Mokarramah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Using RT-PCR.
PG  - 850851
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.850851 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever (DF) is endemic to Makkah and Jeddah, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
      (KSA). However, until recently, the circulation of dengue virus (DENV) in Aedes
      mosquitoes in these areas was unknown. Serological surveillance of DENV in Ae
      aegypti is a powerful tool for early detection of dengue outbreaks and essential 
      for developing effective control strategies. Therefore, this research aimed to
      examine a sample of adult Ae aegypti mosquitoes from Makkah, KSA, to detect DENV.
      In total, 1295 Ae aegypti mosquitoes were collected from the field from target
      areas of Makkah with a high incidence and prevalence of DF. The samples were
      divided into 259 coded pools (five mosquitoes in each) and preserved in 1.5 mL
      plastic tubes. The tubes were labeled, capped, and stored at-86 degrees C until
      use. RT-PCR was used to detect DENV in the samples. All positive pools were
      confirmed by RT-PCR. The RT-PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis
      (1.5% agarose in Tris-acetate EDTA buffer), stained with ethidium bromide, and
      visualized. DENV was isolated from six female Ae Aegypti collected from six pools
      (out of 259 pools). No other viruses were detected. Only five of the nine target 
      localities had positive pools. Samples from the remaining four localities yielded
      negative results. Four DENV-positive mosquitoes were collected at the aquatic
      stages, and two were collected at the adult stage. These results show the
      circulation of DENV in adult mosquitoes and offspring, indicating vertical
      transmission of DENV. In conclusion, this study found that, in Makkah, DENV is
      circulating in dengue vectors with a high significance rate, suggesting the
      possibility of a dengue outbreak in the future; therefore, a sensitive
      surveillance system is vital to predict the outbreak and for early intervention
      and control.

AB  - Background: During the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, outbreaks of Zika
      were reported from Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra, India in 2021. The
      Dengue and Chikungunya negative samples were retrospectively screened to
      determine the presence of the Zika virus from different geographical regions of
      India. Methods: During May to October 2021, the clinical samples of 1475
      patients, across 13 states and a union territory of India were screened and
      re-tested for Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika by CDC Trioplex Real time RT-PCR. The 
      Zika rRTPCR positive samples were further screened with anti-Zika IgM and Plaque 
      Reduction Neutralization Test. Next generation sequencing was used for further
      molecular characterization. Results: The positivity was observed for Zika (67),
      Dengue (121), and Chikungunya (10) amongst screened cases. The co-infections of
      Dengue/Chikungunya, Dengue/Zika, and Dengue/Chikungunya/Zika were also observed. 
      All Zika cases were symptomatic with fever (84%) and rash (78%) as major
      presenting symptoms. Of them, four patients had respiratory distress, one
      presented with seizures, and one with suspected microcephaly at birth. The Asian 
      Lineage of Zika and all four serotypes of Dengue were found in circulation.
      Conclusion: Our study indicates the spread of the Zika virus to several states of
      India and an urgent need to strengthen its surveillance.

AB  - During the epidemic, the individuals with underlying diseases usually have a
      higher rate of mortality. Diabetes is highly prevalent worldwide, making it a
      frequent comorbidity in dengue fever patients. Therefore, understanding the
      relationship between dengue virus (DENV) infection and diabetes is important. We 
      first demonstrated that DENV-3 infection down-regulated the expression of IRS-1. 
      In vitro, treatment of HepG2 cells with TNF-alpha inhibitors and siRNA proved
      that after DENV-3 infection in HepG2 cells, cellular TNF-alpha secretion was
      increased, which negatively regulated IRS-1, thereby leading to an
      insulin-resistant state. In vivo, DENV-3 induced insulin resistance (IR) in
      hepatocytes by promoting the secretion of TNF-alpha and inhibiting the expression
      of IRS-1 was proved. In vivo approaches also showed that after DENV-3 infection, 
      TNF-alpha levels in the serum of C57BL/6 mice with insulin resistance increased, 
      and upon TNF-alpha antagonist III treatment, IRS-1 expression in the liver,
      reduced by infection, was upregulated. In addition, transcriptomic analysis
      revealed more negative regulatory events in the insulin receptor signaling
      pathway after DENV-3 infection. This is the first report of a link between DENV-3
      infection and insulin resistance, and it lays a foundation for further research.

AB  - Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) are primary vectors of
      human arboviral diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika
      viruses. Aedes aegypti is well distributed in Sudan, except in Northern and
      Khartoum states, while Ae. albopictus has not been previously reported. Recently,
      Eastern Sudan witnessed an unprecedented large outbreak of chikungunya fever
      between 31 May 2018 and 30 March 2019. The outbreak was composed of four waves;
      one of them was in Kassala state. Aedes survey in localities of Kassala state
      (rather than Kassala city) is carried out to assess the possible expansion of the
      disease in the state. The results showed the presence of immature stages of Aedes
      spp. in four localities from ten localities. From the four localities that
      recorded Aedes spp., two localities (Rural Kassala and West Kassala) were
      reported with chikungunya cases. From this investigation, Ae. albopictus was
      reported for the first time in Sudan. Also, this investigation showed the
      importance of conducting entomological surveys with epidemiological surveys
      during outbreaks of arboviral diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies serve a crucial immuno-protective
      function mediated by IgG Fc receptors (FcgammaR). Absence of fucose on the highly
      conserved N-linked glycan in the IgG Fc domain strongly enhances IgG binding and 
      activation of myeloid and natural killer (NK) cell FcgammaRs. Although
      afucosylated IgG can provide increased protection (malaria and HIV), it also
      boosts immunopathologies in alloimmune diseases, COVID-19 and dengue fever.
      Quantifying IgG fucosylation currently requires sophisticated methods such as
      liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and extensive analytical skills
      reserved to highly specialized laboratories. METHODS: Here, we introduce the
      Fucose-sensitive Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Antigen-Specific
      IgG (FEASI), an immunoassay capable of simultaneously quantitating and
      qualitatively determining IgG responses. FEASI is a two-tier immunoassay; the
      first assay is used to quantify antigen-specific IgG (IgG ELISA), while the
      second gives FcgammaRIIIa binding-dependent readout which is highly sensitive to 
      both the IgG quantity and the IgG Fc fucosylation (FcgammaR-IgG ELISA). FINDINGS:
      IgG Fc fucosylation levels, independently determined by LC-MS and FEASI, in
      COVID-19 responses to the spike (S) antigen, correlated very strongly by simple
      linear regression (R(2)=0.93, p < 0.0001). The FEASI method was then used to
      quantify IgG levels and fucosylation in COVID-19 convalescent plasma which was
      independently validated by LC-MS. INTERPRETATION: FEASI can be reliably
      implemented to measure relative and absolute IgG Fc fucosylation and quantify
      binding of antigen-specific IgG to FcgammaR in a high-throughput manner
      accessible to all diagnostic and research laboratories. FUNDING: This work was

TI  - Structure of the Dengue Virus RNA Promoter.

AB  - Dengue virus, a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus, is the most prevalent
      mosquito-borne pathogen in the world. Like all RNA viruses, it uses conserved
      structural elements within its genome to control essential replicative steps. A
      70 nucleotides stem-loop RNA structure (called SLA) found at the 5'-end of the
      genome of all flaviviruses, functions as the promoter for viral replication. This
      highly conserved structure interacts with the viral polymerase NS5 to initiate
      RNA synthesis. Here we report the NMR structure of a monomeric SLA from Dengue
      virus serotype 1, assembled to high-resolution from independently folded
      structural elements. The DENV1 SLA has an L-shape structure, where the top and
      side helices are coaxially-stacked and the bottom helix is roughly perpendicular 
      to them. Because the sequence is highly conserved among different flavivirus
      genomes, it is likely that the three-dimensional fold and local structure of SLA 
      are also conserved among flaviviruses and required for efficient replication.
      This work provides structural insight into the Dengue promoter and provides the
      foundation for the discovery of new antiviral drugs that target this essential
      replicative step.

TI  - Evaluation of Zika rapid tests as aids for clinical diagnosis and epidemic
      preparedness.
PG  - 101478
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101478 [doi]
AB  - Background: Development and evaluation of diagnostics for diseases of epidemic
      potential are often funded during epidemics, but not afterwards, leaving
      countries unprepared for the next epidemic. United Nations Children's Emergency
      Fund (UNICEF) partnered with the United States Agency for International
      Development (USAID) to address this important gap by investing in an advance
      purchase commitment (APC) mechanism to accelerate the development and evaluation 
      of Zika rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for case detection and surveillance. This
      paper describes the performance evaluation of five Zika RDTs eligible for
      procurement. Methods: A network of European Union-funded ZikaPLAN sites in
      Africa, Asia, Latin America with access to relevant serum specimens were selected
      to evaluate RDTs developed for the UNICEF APC mechanism. A standardised protocol 
      and evaluation panels were developed and a call for specimens for the evaluation 
      panels issued to different sites. Each site contributed specimens to the
      evaluation from their biobank. Data were collated, analysed and presented to the 
      UNICEF Procurement Review Group for review. Findings: Three RDTs met the criteria
      for UNICEF procurement of sensitivity and specificity of 85% against a refence
      standard. The sensitivity/specificity of the ChemBio anti-Zika Virus (ZIKV)
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) test was 86.4 %/86.7% and the ChemBio ZCD system for
      anti-ZIKV IgM was 79.0%/97.1%, anti-dengue virus (DENV) IgM 90.0%/89.2%,
      anti-Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) IgM 90.6%/97.2%. The sensitivity/specificity of
      the SD Biosensor anti-ZIKV IgM was 96.8 %/90.8%, anti-DENV IgM 71.8%/83.5%, the
      DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) glycoprotein 90.0%/90.2%, anti- yellow fever
      virus (YFV) IgM 84.6%/92.4%, anti-CHIKV IgM 86.3%/97.5%. Interpretation: Three
      RDTs fulfilled the performance thresholds set by WHO and were eligible for UNICEF
      procurement. These tests will improve the diagnosis of ZIKV and other arboviral
      infections as well as providing countries with better tools for surveillance and 
      response to future epidemics. Funding: This work was supported by the USAID grant
      GHA-G-00-07-00007 and ZikaPLAN (European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and
      Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No. 734584).

TI  - Development of a Singleplex Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase PCR Assay for
      Pan-Dengue Virus Detection and Quantification.
LID - 1271 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061271 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a significant global health problem. There are
      no specific therapeutics or widely available vaccines. Early diagnosis is
      critical for patient management. Viral RNA detection by multiplex RT-PCR using
      multiple pairs of primers/probes allowing the simultaneous detection of all four 
      DENV serotypes is commonly used. However, increasing the number of primers in the
      RT-PCR reaction reduces the sensitivity of detection due to the increased
      possibility of primer dimer formation. Here, a one tube, singleplex real-time
      RT-PCR specific to DENV 3'-UTR was developed for the detection and quantification
      of pan-DENV with no cross reactivity to other flaviviruses. The sensitivity of
      DENV detection was as high as 96.9% in clinical specimens collected at the first 
      day of hospitalization. Our assay provided equivalent PCR efficiency and RNA
      quantification among each DENV serotype. The assay's performance was comparable
      with previously established real-time RT-PCR targeting coding sequences. Using
      both assays on the same specimens, our results indicate the presence of defective
      virus particles in the circulation of patients infected with all serotypes. Dual 
      regions targeting RT-PCR enhanced the sensitivity of viral genome detection
      especially during the late acute phase when viremia rapidly decline and an
      incomplete viral genome was clinically evident.

LID - 10.3390/v14061253 [doi]
AB  - Since the first isolation in 1943, the dengue virus (DENV) has spread throughout 
      the world, but effective antiviral drugs or vaccines are still not available. To 
      provide a more stable reporter DENV for vaccine development and antiviral drug
      screening, we constructed a reporter DENV containing the NanoLuc reporter gene,
      which was inserted into the 5' untranslated region and capsid junction region,
      enabling rapid virus rescue by in vitro ligation. In addition, we established a
      live imaging mouse model and found that the reporter virus maintained the
      neurovirulence of prototype DENV before engineering. DENV-4 exhibited
      dramatically increased neurovirulence following a glycosylation site-defective
      mutation in the envelope protein. Significant mice mortality with neurological
      onset symptoms was observed after intracranial infection of wild-type (WT) mice, 
      thus providing a visualization tool for DENV virulence assessment. Using this
      model, DENV was detected in the intestinal tissues of WT mice after infection,
      suggesting that intestinal lymphoid tissues play an essential role in DENV
      pathogenesis.

TI  - Azelnidipine Exhibits In Vitro and In Vivo Antiviral Effects against Flavivirus
      Infections by Targeting the Viral RdRp.
LID - 1228 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061228 [doi]
AB  - Flaviviruses, represented by Zika and dengue virus (ZIKV and DENV), are widely
      present around the world and cause various diseases with serious consequences.
      However, no antiviral drugs have been clinically approved for use against them.
      Azelnidipine (ALP) is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and has been
      approved for use as an antihypertensive drug. In the present study, ALP was found
      to show potent anti-flavivirus activities in vitro and in vivo. ALP effectively
      prevented the cytopathic effect induced by ZIKV and DENV and inhibited the
      production of viral RNA and viral protein in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover,
      treatment with 0.3 mg/kg of ALP protected 88.89% of mice from lethal challenge.
      Furthermore, using the time-of-drug-addition assay, the enzymatic inhibition
      assay, the molecular docking, and the surface plasmon resonance assay, we
      revealed that ALP acted at the replication stage of the viral infection cycle by 
      targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These findings highlight the
      potential for the use of ALP as an antiviral agent to combat flavivirus
      infections.

LID - 10.3390/v14061226 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-borne flavivirus infections affect approximately 400 million people
      worldwide each year and are global threats to public health. The common diseases 
      caused by such flaviviruses include West Nile, yellow fever, dengue, Zika
      infection and Japanese encephalitis, which may result in severe symptoms and
      disorders of multiple organs or even fatal outcomes. Till now, no specific
      antiviral agents are commercially available for the treatment of the diseases.
      Numerous strategies have been adopted to develop novel and promising inhibitors
      against mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including drugs targeting the critical viral
      components or essential host factors during infection. Research advances in
      antiflaviviral therapy might optimize and widen the treatment options for
      flavivirus infection. This review summarizes the current developmental progresses
      and involved molecular mechanisms of antiviral agents against mosquito-borne
      flaviviruses.

TI  - Cross-Reactive Immunity among Five Medically Important Mosquito-Borne
      Flaviviruses Related to Human Diseases.
LID - 1213 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061213 [doi]
AB  - Flaviviruses cause a spectrum of potentially severe diseases. Most flaviviruses
      are transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks and are widely distributed all over the
      world. Among them, several mosquito-borne flaviviruses are co-epidemic, and the
      similarity of their antigenicity creates abundant cross-reactive immune responses
      which complicate their prevention and control. At present, only effective
      vaccines against yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis have been used
      clinically, while the optimal vaccines against other flavivirus diseases are
      still under development. The antibody-dependent enhancement generated by
      cross-reactive immune responses against different serotypes of dengue virus makes
      the development of the dengue fever vaccine a bottleneck. It has been proposed
      that the cross-reactive immunity elicited by prior infection of mosquito-borne
      flavivirus could also affect the outcome of the subsequent infection of
      heterologous flavivirus. In this review, we focused on five medically important
      flaviviruses, and rearranged and recapitulated their cross-reactive immunity in
      detail from the perspectives of serological experiments in vitro, animal
      experiments in vivo, and human cohort studies. We look forward to providing
      references and new insights for the research of flavivirus vaccines and specific 
      prevention.

TI  - Strategies to Mitigate Establishment under the Wolbachia Incompatible Insect
      Technique.
LID - 1132 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061132 [doi]
AB  - The Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) strategy involves the release of male
      mosquitoes infected with the bacterium Wolbachia. Regular releases of male
      Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes can lead to the suppression of mosquito
      populations, thereby reducing the risk of transmission of vector-borne diseases
      such as dengue. However, due to imperfect sex-sorting under IIT, fertile
      Wolbachia-infected female mosquitoes may potentially be unintentionally released 
      into the environment, which may result in replacement and failure to suppress the
      mosquito populations. As such, mitigating Wolbachia establishment requires a
      combination of IIT with other strategies. We introduced a simple compartmental
      model to simulate ex-ante mosquito population dynamics subjected to a
      Wolbachia-IIT programme. In silico, we explored the risk of replacement, and
      strategies that could mitigate the establishment of the released Wolbachia strain
      in the mosquito population. Our results suggest that mitigation may be achieved
      through the application of a sterile insect technique. Our simulations indicate
      that these interventions do not override the intended wild type suppression of
      the IIT approach. These findings will inform policy makers of possible ways to
      mitigate the potential establishment of Wolbachia using the IIT population
      control strategy.

TI  - Nucleic Acid Vaccine Platform for DENGUE and ZIKA Flaviviruses.
LID - 834 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10060834 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus and Zika virus are mosquito-borne, single-stranded, positive-sense
      RNA viruses that belong to the Flaviviridae family. Both the viruses are closely 
      related and have similarities with other flaviviruses. Dengue virus (DENV) causes
      a severe febrile illness with fever, joint pain, and rash leading to a
      life-threatening condition in severe cases. While Zika virus (ZIKV) primarily
      causes mild fever, it can be passed from a pregnant mother to her fetus,
      resulting in severe birth defect microcephaly and even causing a rare autoimmune 
      disease-Guillain-Barre syndrome. To date, there are no approved DENV and ZIKA
      vaccines available, except a Dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia, Sanofi Pasteur Inc.,
      Lyon, France) recently approved to be used only for 9-16 years of age groups
      living in endemic areas and having a previous record of confirmed dengue
      infection. There are several potential vaccine candidates in the clinical trials 
      based on multiple vaccine platforms, such as live attenuated, subunit, nucleic
      acid, and viral vector-based vaccines. In the current review, we have focused
      exclusively on the nucleic acid vaccine platform and discussed the progress of
      all the DNA/RNA vaccine candidates under preclinical and clinical studies for
      DENV and ZIKA viruses. Additionally, we have described a brief history of the
      emergence of these flaviviruses, major structural similarities between them,
      prominent vaccine targets, and the mechanism of virus entry and infection.

TI  - Near-Infrared Spectroscopy as a Potential COVID-19 Early Detection Method: A
      Review and Future Perspective.
LID - 4391 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22124391 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide health anxiety.
      The rapid dispersion of the infection globally results in unparalleled economic, 
      social, and health impacts. The pathogen that causes COVID-19 is known as a
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A fast and low-cost
      diagnosis method for COVID-19 disease can play an important role in controlling
      its proliferation. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a quick, non-destructive,
      non-invasive, and inexpensive technique for profiling the chemical and physical
      structures of a wide range of samples. Furthermore, the NIRS has the advantage of
      incorporating the internet of things (IoT) application for the effective control 
      and treatment of the disease. In recent years, a significant advancement in
      instrumentation and spectral analysis methods has resulted in a remarkable impact
      on the NIRS applications, especially in the medical discipline. To date, NIRS has
      been applied as a technique for detecting various viruses including zika (ZIKV), 
      chikungunya (CHIKV), influenza, hepatitis C, dengue (DENV), and human
      immunodeficiency (HIV). This review aims to outline some historical and
      contemporary applications of NIRS in virology and its merit as a novel diagnostic
      technique for SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Genetic Diversity among Four Populations of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)
      from Honduras as Revealed by Mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome Oxidase I.
LID - 620 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11060620 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is a hematophagous and highly anthropophilic mosquito with a wide
      distribution, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Ae. 
      aegypti is the main vector of several febrile diseases called arboviruses
      (dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and zika viruses), which represent an
      important public health problem. Populations of this mosquito were nearly
      eliminated from the Americas in the mid-20th century; however, after the
      abandonment of control measures, mosquito populations have been recovering
      territory, have expanded by anthropogenic mechanisms, and have been joined by new
      populations reintroduced from other continents. The objective of this pilot study
      was to determine the genetic variability of Aedes aegypti collected in four
      cities located along the so-called logistics corridor of Honduras, which connects
      the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean. We studied the sequences of two molecular
      markers: the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI mtDNA) gene and the internal transcribed
      spacer 2 (ITS2 rDNA) of 40 mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analyzes show two separate
      clades with a low number of nucleotide differences per site, three haplotypes,
      and low haplotype diversity. These results suggest a low genetic diversity in the
      populations of Ae. aegypti in Honduras in relation to that reported in other
      countries of the Central American isthmus.

TI  - Flavivirus NS1 Triggers Tissue-Specific Disassembly of Intercellular Junctions
      Leading to Barrier Dysfunction and Vascular Leak in a GSK-3beta-Dependent Manner.
LID - 615 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11060615 [doi]
AB  - The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected cells and 
      contributes to endothelial barrier dysfunction and vascular leak in a
      tissue-dependent manner. This phenomenon occurs in part via disruption of the
      endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) lining the endothelium. Additionally, we and
      others have shown that soluble DENV NS1 induces disassembly of intercellular
      junctions (IJCs), a group of cellular proteins critical for maintaining
      endothelial homeostasis and regulating vascular permeability; however, the
      specific mechanisms by which NS1 mediates IJC disruption remain unclear. Here, we
      investigated the relative contribution of five flavivirus NS1 proteins, from
      dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), and
      yellow fever (YFV) viruses, to the expression and localization of the
      intercellular junction proteins beta-catenin and VE-cadherin in endothelial cells
      from human umbilical vein and brain tissues. We found that flavivirus NS1 induced
      the mislocalization of beta-catenin and VE-cadherin in a tissue-dependent manner,
      reflecting flavivirus disease tropism. Mechanistically, we observed that NS1
      treatment of cells triggered internalization of VE-cadherin, likely via
      clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and phosphorylation of beta-catenin, part of a
      canonical IJC remodeling pathway during breakdown of endothelial barriers that
      activates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Supporting this model, we
      found that a chemical inhibitor of GSK-3beta reduced both NS1-induced
      permeability of human umbilical vein and brain microvascular endothelial cell
      monolayers in vitro and vascular leakage in a mouse dorsal intradermal model.
      These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating
      NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction and identify GSK-3beta as a potential
      therapeutic target for treatment of vascular leakage during severe dengue
      disease.

TI  - Lineage Replacement Associated with Fitness Gain in Mammalian Cells and Aedes
      aegypti: A Catalyst for Dengue Virus Type 2 Transmission.
LID - 1100 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10061100 [doi]
AB  - Shifting of virus serotypes and clade replacement events are known to drive
      dengue epidemics. However, only a few studies have attempted to elucidate the
      virus attributes that contribute to such epidemics. In 2007, Singapore
      experienced a dengue outbreak affecting more than 8000 individuals. The outbreak 
      ensued with the shuffling of dominant clades (from clade I to clade II) of Dengue
      virus 2 (DENV-2) cosmopolitan genotype, at a time when the Aedes premise index
      was significantly low. Therefore, we hypothesized that clade II had higher
      epidemic potential and fitness than clade I. To test this hypothesis, we tested
      the replication and apoptotic qualities of clade I and II isolates in mammalian
      cells and their ability to infect and disseminate in a field strain of Ae.
      Aegypti. Our findings indicated that clade II replicated more efficiently in
      mammalian cells than clade I and possessed higher transmission potential in local
      vectors. This could collectively improve the epidemic potential of clade II,
      which dominated during the outbreak in 2007. The findings exemplify complex
      interactions between the emergence, adaptation and transmission potential of
      DENV, and testify the epidemiological importance of a deeper understanding of
      virus and vector dynamics in endemic regions.

TI  - Dengue Seroprevalence and Factors Associated with Dengue Seropositivity in
      Petaling District, Malaysia.
LID - 7170 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19127170 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a major public health concern, posing huge
      economic and disease burdens globally. In Malaysia, the incidence of DENV
      infections has increased significantly over the years. Nevertheless, the passive 
      surveillance mechanism applied may not capture the actual magnitude of DENV
      infection. There was also a paucity of community-based studies exploring DENV
      seroprevalence. This study aimed to determine the DENV seroprevalence and the
      associated factors among the urban population in Petaling district, Malaysia. A
      population-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 18 August to 26 October
      2018 with 533 participants recruited. Blood samples were collected and analysed
      for DENV seropositivity using a composite reference standard comprised of three
      dengue serological tests. Associated factors were identified by fitting
      Generalised Linear Mixed Models with binomial error structure and logit link
      function. DENV seroprevalence obtained was 79.0% (95% CI: 75.2-82.4%). The
      age-specific DENV seroprevalence showed an increasing trend with advancing age,
      from 22.7% (95% CI: 9.6-45.0%) for those aged below five years old to 94.9% (95% 
      CI: 81.3-98.7%) for those aged >/=60 years old. Only age group and house level
      were found to be significant factors associated with DENV seropositivity. The
      odds of being DENV seropositive generally increased with age, from 13.43 (95% CI:
      2.77-65.22) for the 5-9 years old age group to 384.77 (95% CI: 39.27-3769.97) for
      the >/=60 years old age group, as compared to those aged below 5 years old. For
      house level, those who lived on the first and second floor (OR: 8.98, 95% CI:
      3.16-25.12) and the third floor and above (OR: 4.82, 95% CI: 1.89-12.32) had
      greater odds of being DENV seropositive compared to those living on the ground
      floor. This study demonstrated the persistently high DENV seroprevalence among
      the urban population in Petaling district, which could be useful to evaluate
      dengue control measures taken and estimate more accurate disease incidence. The
      associated factors with DENV seropositivity identified could also contribute to
      undertaking more targeted preventive and control measures.

TI  - Impact of Plantation Induced Forest Degradation on the Outbreak of Emerging
      Infectious Diseases-Wayanad District, Kerala, India.
LID - 7036 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19127036 [doi]
AB  - The world has been facing a pandemic owing to COVID-19. We have also seen the
      geographic expansion and outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases (EID) in
      recent years. This paper investigates the direct and indirect effects of land use
      land cover change (LULCC) on EID outbreaks in the context of Wayanad District of 
      Kerala, India. Wayanad is in the vulnerable tropical forested region, and it is
      named as one of the four environmental change hotspots. The focus of this project
      is mainly three EIDs prevalent in this region: Kyasanur forest disease (KFD),
      Dengue and Leptospirosis. Our results, based on topographical map, remote sensing
      and extensive field work, show that the natural forest in Wayanad was replaced
      with agriculture and forest plantation during 1950-2018. This paper further
      suggests that encroachment of forest by forest plantation causes the human-animal
      conflict resulting in the outbreak of KFD cases. Our analysis reveals that a high
      number of Dengue cases is found in the forested regions of the district and over 
      the adjacent human-made agriculture plantation areas. High and medium number of
      Leptospirosis cases contain a high portion of land area devoted to paddy
      cultivation and agricultural plantation. In summary, the results clearly show the
      linkage between the outbreak of above mentioned EIDs and LULCC in the context of 
      Wayanad district, Kerala. We also discuss in detail the causal pathway involving 
      human-environmental dynamics through which plantation leads to the outbreak of
      KFD. Replacing forests with plantations poses an alarming threat of disease
      outbreak in the community.

TI  - Efficacy of a spatial repellent for control of Aedes-borne virus transmission: A 
      cluster-randomized trial in Iquitos, Peru.
PG  - e2118283119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2118283119 [doi]
AB  - Over half the world's population is at risk for viruses transmitted by Aedes
      mosquitoes, such as dengue and Zika. The primary vector, Aedes aegypti, thrives
      in urban environments. Despite decades of effort, cases and geographic range of
      Aedes-borne viruses (ABVs) continue to expand. Rigorously proven vector control
      interventions that measure protective efficacy against ABV diseases are limited
      to Wolbachia in a single trial in Indonesia and do not include any chemical
      intervention. Spatial repellents, a new option for efficient deployment, are
      designed to decrease human exposure to ABVs by releasing active ingredients into 
      the air that disrupt mosquito-human contact. A parallel, cluster-randomized
      controlled trial was conducted in Iquitos, Peru, to quantify the impact of a
      transfluthrin-based spatial repellent on human ABV infection. From 2,907
      households across 26 clusters (13 per arm), 1,578 participants were assessed for 
      seroconversion (primary endpoint) by survival analysis. Incidence of acute
      disease was calculated among 16,683 participants (secondary endpoint). Adult
      mosquito collections were conducted to compare Ae. aegypti abundance, blood-fed
      rate, and parity status through mixed-effect difference-in-difference analyses.
      The spatial repellent significantly reduced ABV infection by 34.1% (one-sided 95%
      CI lower limit, 6.9%; one-sided P value = 0.0236, z = 1.98). Aedes aegypti
      abundance and blood-fed rates were significantly reduced by 28.6 (95% CI 24.1%,
      infinity); z = -9.11) and 12.4% (95% CI 4.2%, infinity); z = -2.43),
      respectively. Our trial provides conclusive statistical evidence from an
      appropriately powered, preplanned cluster-randomized controlled clinical trial of
      the impact of a chemical intervention, in this case a spatial repellent, to
      reduce the risk of ABV transmission compared to a placebo.

TI  - Continuous Circulation of Chikungunya Virus during COVID-19 Pandemic in Jambi,
      Sumatra, Indonesia.
LID - 91 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/tropicalmed7060091 [doi]
AB  - Chikungunya fever is a self-limiting viral illness that is caused by the
      chikungunya virus (CHIKV). CHIKV is found in multiple provinces of Indonesia,
      with clustered local outbreaks. This case series investigates a local chikungunya
      outbreak during the COVID-19 pandemic, involving two virologically confirmed
      chikungunya cases found in Jambi, Sumatra, Indonesia in 2021 and the contact
      tracing of 65 people from the same neighborhood (one of which was also
      virologically confirmed with CHIKV). The two original cases were symptomatic with
      classic signs of chikungunya fever, while the CHIKV-positive neighbor was
      asymptomatic. Out of the 65 participants, chikungunya IgM was detected in seven
      (10.8%) people while chikungunya IgG was detected in six (9.2%) using capture
      ELISA. Dengue IgG was detected by rapid test in three (4.6%) of the participants,
      showcasing a history of dengue virus (DENV) infection along with the circulation 
      of CHIKV in the area. A phylogenetic analysis demonstrates a close evolutionary
      relationship between all three 2021 Jambi CHIKV isolates and the 2015-2016
      isolates from Jambi. This case series showcases the endemicity and persistent
      circulation of CHIKV in Jambi, leaving the area vulnerable to eminent outbreaks
      of chikungunya fever and doubling the burden of disease during the COVID-19
      pandemic. Health staff training for case detection and notification, as well as
      an integrated vector surveillance should continue to be implemented to provide an
      early warning indicator of possible chikungunya outbreaks.

TI  - Child Marriage, Reproductive Outcomes, and Service Utilization among Young Afghan
      Women: Findings from a Nationally Representative Survey in Afghanistan.
LID - 10.1111/sifp.12207 [doi]
AB  - This study explored the prevalence of child marriage and its association with
      reproductive outcomes and service utilization among young women in Afghanistan.
      We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic
      and Health Survey (DHS), focusing on women aged 20-24 years old based on the
      United Nations' recommendation on child marriage study. Multivariate logistic
      models examined the association between child marriage, reproductive outcomes,
      and service utilization. An estimated 52% of the Afghan women aged 20-24 married 
      at ages less than 18 years. Poverty and illiteracy were associated with the
      higher likelihood of early marriage. There was a significant negative
      relationship between child marriage and history of rapid repeat childbirth,
      delivery by skilled personnel, and institutional delivery. In both adjusted and
      unadjusted models, women married at age </=14 were more likely to experience
      terminated or unintended pregnancy, inadequate ANC, unmet need for family
      planning, and fistula; while, for those married at age 15-17 years, only
      terminated or unintended pregnancy remained significant. Strict international law
      enforcement and advocacy are needed in the current situation of Afghanistan to
      increase young women's education, promote their civil rights, and improve their
      autonomy and role in decision-making concerning their fertility preferences and
      reproductive health.

TI  - Insights into the product release mechanism of dengue virus NS3 helicase.
LID - gkac473 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac473 [doi]
AB  - The non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3h) is a multifunctional protein that is
      critical in RNA replication and other stages in the flavivirus life cycle. NS3h
      uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to translocate along single stranded nucleic acid
      and to unwind double stranded RNA. Here we present a detailed mechanistic
      analysis of the product release stage in the catalytic cycle of the dengue virus 
      (DENV) NS3h. This study is based on a combined experimental and computational
      approach of product-inhibition studies and free energy calculations. Our results 
      support a model in which the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis proceeds through
      an ordered sequential mechanism that includes a ternary complex intermediate
      (NS3h-Pi-ADP), which evolves releasing the first product, phosphate (Pi), and
      subsequently ADP. Our results indicate that in the product release stage of the
      DENV NS3h a novel open-loop conformation plays an important role that may be
      conserved in NS3 proteins of other flaviviruses as well.

      Colombian Aedes aegypti Populations.

AB  - Dengue, Zika, and chikungunya are arboviral diseases for which there are no
      effective therapies or vaccines. The only way to avoid their transmission is by
      controlling the vector Aedes aegypti, but insecticide resistance limits this
      strategy. To generate relevant information for surveillance and control
      mechanisms, we determined life cycle parameters, including longevity, fecundity, 
      and mortality, of Colombian Ae. aegypti populations from four different
      geographical regions: Neiva, Bello, Itagui, and Riohacha. When reared at 28
      degrees C, Bello had the shortest development time, and Riohacha had the longest.
      Each mosquito population had its own characteristic fecundity pattern during four
      gonotrophic cycles. The survival curves of each population were significantly
      different, with Riohacha having the longest survival in both males and females
      and Bello the shortest. High mortality was observed in mosquitoes from Neiva in
      the egg stage and for Bello in the pupae stage. Finally, when mosquitoes from
      Neiva and Bello were reared at 35 degrees C, development times and mortality were
      severely affected. In conclusion, each population has a unique development
      pattern with an innate trace in their biological characteristics that confers
      vulnerability in specific stages of development.

TI  - Dengue encephalitis featuring "double-doughnut" sign - A case report.
PG  - 103939
LID - 10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103939 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Dengue is a common febrile illness caused by Dengue virus and
      spread by Aedes mosquitoes. The neurological complications like encephalopathy or
      encephalitis or immune-mediated neurological syndromes are uncommon though.
      Discrete neuroimaging findings in this setting are even rarer. We report a case
      of dengue encephalitis with uncommon MRI features in a young female. Case
      presentation: The patient presented with complains of fever, vomiting, weakness
      in all limbs and difficulty in speech. Neurological examination revealed
      bilateral horizontal gaze palsy with impaired oculo-cephalic reflex, bulbar
      dysarthria and quadriplegia with bilateral planters up-going. Laboratory reported
      anemia, thrombocytopenia and positive NS1 antigen while excluding other tropical 
      and immunological diseases. Brain MRI revealed extensive thalamic involvement as 
      unique "double-doughnut" sign along with lesions in brainstem. The patient
      received supportive treatment in intensive unit and was discharged following
      improvement in clinical condition and laboratory reports. Clinical discussion:
      Dengue can infect the central nervous system directly as encephalitis or can have
      neurological consequences following multi-organ dysfunction and shock as
      encephalopathy or post-infection immunological syndromes as Guillain-Barre
      Syndrome or cerebrovascular complications or dengue muscle dysfunction. The MRI
      appearance of "double-doughnut" sign points towards dengue encephalitis in
      appropriate setting. Conclusion: A high index of suspicion is required to make a 
      diagnosis of dengue encephalitis. The "double-doughnut" sign in MRI sequences has
      the potential to become a diagnostic marker for dengue encephalitis.

AB  - Introduction:Vector-borne diseases are infections caused by parasites, viruses
      and bacteria and transmitted by vectors, which are usually insects. A greater
      risk of diseases such as dengue, malaria, seasonal influenza, leptospirosis,
      chikungunya, enteric fever, etc co-exist in COVID-19 cases. This poses challenges
      in clinical and laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, which may affect clinical
      management and patient outcomes. Methodology: Several databases, including
      PubMed, Scopus, DOAJ, and EMBASE, were reviewed using the keywords vector-borne
      infections in India amidst COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 23 articles and WHO and 
      National website for vector-borne diseases was found. Review:For many decades,
      vector-borne diseases have been a major health burden for both underdeveloped and
      developing countries, including India. With better preparedness, the threat of
      climate change on vector-borne diseases may be negated. Rains during monsoon
      increase not only the risk of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue,
      chikungunya but also that of food- and water-borne diseases as well as other skin
      infections. A greater risk of diseases such as dengue, malaria, seasonal
      influenza, leptospirosis, chikungunya, enteric fever, etc co-exists in COVID-19
      cases. This poses challenges in clinical and laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19,
      which may affect clinical management and patient outcomes (3). Amidst the
      COVID-19 pandemic, a sudden outbreak of Zika virus infection was reported at the 
      beginning of July 2021 in the districts of Kerala, from where it started,
      spreading to the neighboring states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, India.
      Conclusions:With better preparedness, the threat of climate change on
      vector-borne diseases may be negated. Designing and strengthening an intervention
      strategy for environmental sanitation, regular cleaning of living houses, and
      keeping personal hygiene shall be considered. Risk assessment is crucial to
      optimize surveillance, preventative measures (vector control), and resource
      allocation (medical supplies).

TI  - Parentage Assignment Using Microsatellites Reveals Multiple Mating in Aedes
      aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae): Implications for Mating Dynamics.
LID - tjac081 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjac081 [doi]
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of the dengue, yellow fever, and
      chikungunya viruses. Evidence shows that Ae. aegypti males are polyandrous
      whereas Ae. aegypti females are monandrous in mating. However, the degree to
      which Ae. aegypti males and females can mate with different partners has not been
      rigorously tested. Therefore, this study examined the rates of polyandry via
      parentage assignment in three sets of competitive mating experiments using
      wild-type male and female Ae. aegypti. Parentage assignment was monitored using
      nine microsatellite DNA markers. All Ae. aegypti offspring were successfully
      assigned to parents with 80% or 95% confidence using CERVUS software. The results
      showed that both male and female Ae. aegypti mated with up to 3-4 different
      partners. Adults contributed differentially to the emergent offspring, with
      reproductive outputs ranging from 1 to 25 viable progeny. This study demonstrates
      a new perspective on the capabilities of male and female Ae. aegypti in mating.
      These findings are significant because successful deployment of reproductive
      control methods using genetic modification or sterile Ae. aegypti must consider
      the following criteria regarding their mating fitness: 1) choosing Ae. aegypti
      males that can mate with many different females; 2) testing how transformed Ae.
      aegypti male perform with polyandrous females; and 3) prioritizing the selection 
      of polyandrous males and/or females Ae. aegypti that have the most offspring.

TI  - Zika Virus Strains and Dengue Virus Induce Distinct Proteomic Changes in Neural
      Stem Cells and Neurospheres.
LID - 10.1007/s12035-022-02922-3 [doi]
AB  - Brain abnormalities and congenital malformations have been linked to the
      circulating strain of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil since 2016 during the
      microcephaly outbreak; however, the molecular mechanisms behind several of these 
      alterations and differential viral molecular targets have not been fully
      elucidated. Here we explore the proteomic alterations induced by ZIKV by
      comparing the Brazilian (Br ZIKV) and the African (MR766) viral strains, in
      addition to comparing them to the molecular responses to the Dengue virus type 2 
      (DENV). Neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPSCs)
      were cultured both as monolayers and in suspension (resulting in neurospheres),
      which were then infected with ZIKV (Br ZIKV or ZIKV MR766) or DENV to assess
      alterations within neural cells. Large-scale proteomic analyses allowed the
      comparison not only between viral strains but also regarding the two- and
      three-dimensional cellular models of neural cells derived from iPSCs, and the
      effects on their interaction. Altered pathways and biological processes were
      observed related to cell death, cell cycle dysregulation, and neurogenesis. These
      results reinforce already published data and provide further information
      regarding the biological alterations induced by ZIKV and DENV in neural cells.

TI  - Sensitivity of wMel and wAlbB Wolbachia infections in Aedes aegypti Puducherry
      (Indian) strains to heat stress during larval development.
PG  - 221
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05345-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: ICMR-Vector Control Research Centre, Puducherry, India, developed two
      colonies of Aedes aegypti infected with wMel and wAlbB Wolbacia strains called
      Ae. aegypti (Pud) lines for dengue control. The sensitivity of wMel and wAlbB
      strains in Ae. aegypti (Pud) lines to heat stress was studied. METHODS: wMel and 
      wAlbB infected and uninfected Ae. aegypti larvae (first to fourth instars) were
      reared in the laboratory to adults at 26 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 36 degrees C
      and 40 degrees C constant temperatures and also 26-30 degrees C, 26-36 degrees C 
      and 26-40 degrees C diurnal cyclic temperatures. The adults were tested for
      Wolbachia infection. Experiments were also carried out rearing the larvae under
      simulated field conditions in summer (April and June) under sunlight using fully 
      open and half open bowls and also under sunlight and natural shade. RESULTS: At
      36 degrees C and 40 degrees C constant temperatures, complete larval mortality
      was observed. At 30 degrees C and 26 degrees C, no larval mortality occurred, but
      Wolbachia density was relatively low in wMel infected males compared to control
      (maintained at 26 +/- 1 degrees C). At diurnal cyclic temperature of 26-40
      degrees C, Wolbachia density was reduced in males of both the (Pud) lines, but
      not in females. At 26-36 degrees C, reduction in Wolbachia density was observed
      in wMel males but not in wAlbB males. At 26-30 degrees C, no significant
      reduction in Wolbachia density was observed with wMel and wAlbB strains. In
      simulated field conditions (April), under sunlight, the daytime water temperature
      reached a maximum of 35.7 degrees C in both full and half open bowls. No larval
      mortality occurred. Wolbachia frequency and density was reduced in wMel-infected 
      Ae. aegypti (Pud) males from both type of bowls and in females from full open
      bowls, and in wAlbB males from half open bowls. In June, rearing of larvae under 
      sunlight, the first-instar larvae experienced a maximum daytime water temperature
      of > 38 degrees C that caused complete mortality. No larval mortality was
      observed in bowls kept under shade (< 32 degrees C). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of
      larvae to higher rearing temperatures in the laboratory and simulated-field
      conditions reduced the densities of wMel and wAlbB strains particularly in males,
      but the impact was more pronounced for wMel strain. The actual effect of heat
      stress on the stability of these two Wolbachia strains needs to be tested under
      natural field conditions.

AB  - Chebulinic acid (CA), originally isolated from the flower extract of the plant
      Terminalia chebula, has been shown to inhibit infection of herpes simplex virus-2
      (HSV-2), suggestively by inhibiting the host entry step of viral infection. Like 
      HSV-2, the dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) also use receptor
      glycosaminoglycans (GAG) to gain host entry, therefore, the activity of CA was
      tested against these viruses. Co-treatment of 8 microM CA with DENV-2 caused 2
      log decrease in the virus titer (4.0 log10FFU/mL) at 120 h post infection,
      compared to virus control (5.95 log10FFU/mL). In contrast, no inhibitory effect
      of CA was observed against CHIKV infection under any condition. The mechanism of 
      action of CA was investigated in silico by employing DENV-2 and CHIKV envelope
      glycoproteins. During docking, CA demonstrated equivalent binding at multiple
      sites on DENV-2 envelope protein, including GAG binding site, which have
      previously been reported to play a crucial role in host attachment and fusion,
      indicating blocking of these sites. However, CA did not show binding to the GAG
      binding site on envelope protein-2 of CHIKV. The in vitro and in silico findings 
      suggest that CA possesses the ability to inhibit DENV-2 infection at the entry
      stage of its infection cycle and may be developed as a potential therapeutic
      agent against it.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss the neurological complications of dengue virus
      (DENV) infection and their pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Include recognition of 
      the four different serotypes of DENV and their epidemiology as well as
      recognition of the expanded dengue syndrome encompassing multisystem involvement 
      in the severe form of the disease including involvement of the central nervous
      system (CNS). DENV is a neurotropic virus with the ability to infect the
      supporting cells of the CNS. Neural injury during the acute stage of the
      infection results from direct neuro-invasion and/or the phenomenon of
      antibody-dependent enhancement, resulting in plasma leakage and coagulopathy.
      Immune mechanisms have been implicated in the development of the delayed
      neurological sequelae through molecular mimicry. A myriad of neurological
      syndromes has been described as a result of the involvement of the CNS, the
      peripheral nervous system (PNS), or both. Neurological manifestations in DENV
      infection are increasingly being recognized, some of which are potentially fatal 
      if not treated promptly. DENV encephalopathy and encephalitis should be
      considered in the differential diagnosis of other acute febrile encephalopathies,
      autoimmune encephalitides, and in cases of encephalopathy/encephalitis related to
      SARS-CoV2 infection, especially in dengue-endemic areas. Acute disseminated
      encephalomyelitis (ADEM) may be occasionally encountered. Clinicians should be
      knowledgeable of the expanded dengue syndrome characterized by the concurrent
      compromise of cardiac, neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, and hematopopoietic
      systems. Isolated cranial nerve palsies occur rather uncommonly and are often
      steroid responsive. These neuropathies may result from the direct involvement of 
      cranial nerve nuclei or nerve involvement or may be immune-mediated. Even if the 
      diagnosis of dengue is confirmed, it is absolutely imperative to exclude other
      well-known causes of isolated cranial nerve palsies. Ischemic and hemorrhagic
      strokes may occur following dengue fever. The pathogenesis may be beyond the
      commonly observed thrombocytopenia and include cerebral vasculitis. Involvement
      of ocular blood vessels may cause maculopathy or retinal hemorrhages. Posterior
      reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is uncommon and possibly related to
      dysregulated cytokine release phenomena. Lastly, any patient developing acute
      neuromuscular weakness during the course or within a fortnight of remission from 
      dengue fever must be screened for acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
      (AIDP), hypokalemic paralysis, or acute myositis. Rarely, a Miller-Fisher-like
      syndrome with negative anti-GQ1b antibody may develop.

TI  - Neurological Manifestations of Scrub Typhus.
PG  - 491-498
LID - 10.1007/s11910-022-01215-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The occurrence of cases of scrub typhus is on the rise in
      South Asian and Southeast Asian countries. The present review discusses
      neurological complications following scrub typhus to appraise clinicians
      practicing in endemic regions about considering this treatable disease in the
      differential diagnosis of acute febrile illnesses, especially when accompanied
      with clinical neurological features. RECENT FINDINGS: While the association of
      aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and meningoencephalitis with scrub typhus is
      well known, more recently described neurological syndromes associated with scrub 
      typhus include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, various cranial nerve
      palsies, cerebellitis, cerebrovascular diseases including cerebral venous sinus
      thrombosis, transverse myelitis, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis,
      Guillain-Barre syndrome, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, parkinsonism, and many
      more. Early diagnosis is key to successful treatment. While diagnostic
      confirmation is generally made by the detection of IgM antibody by either ELISA
      or indirect fluorescent antibody tests, conventional PCR using 56 kDa gene (cPCR)
      and loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP assay), as well as a newly
      introduced metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), are currently available
      for detection of Orientia tsutsugamushi infection in clinically suspected cases. 
      Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. The
      cutaneous hallmark of the disease is the "eschar." Scrub typhus results in
      multisystem involvement. Neurological compromise is present in about 20% of scrub
      typhus patients and affects both the central nervous system and the peripheral
      nervous system. The postulated underlying mechanisms include direct invasion of
      the organism, a vasculitis-like process, or an immune-mediated injury. Diagnosis 
      of scrub typhus is confirmed by detection of O. tsutsugamushi IgM antibody in
      serum. Awareness among clinicians regarding the varied presentations of this
      disease is very important in order to reduce morbidity and mortality.
      Co-infection with dengue and/or chickungunya viruses may occur in endemic
      regions. The history of an acute febrile illness preceding the neurological
      illness is crucial. A very careful search for the eschar is essential; however,
      the absence of the skin lesion cannot exclude the diagnosis of scrub typhus.
      Neurological manifestations mostly respond to doxycycline therapy.

TI  - Mitigating the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections with vector-borne
      agents solely by means of pathogen reduction.
PG  - 1388-1398
LID - 10.1111/trf.16950 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated whether pathogen reduction technology (PRT) in
      plasma and platelets using amotosalen/ultraviolet A light (A/UVA) or in red blood
      cells using amustaline/glutathione (S-303/GSH) may be used as the sole mitigation
      strategy preventing transfusion-transmitted West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV), Zika 
      (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV) viral, and Babesia microti, Trypanosoma cruzi,
      and Plasmodium parasitic infections. METHODS: Antibody (Ab) status and pathogen
      loads (copies/mL) were obtained for donations from US blood donors testing
      nucleic acid (NAT)-positive for WNV, DENV, ZIKV, CHIKV, and B. microti.
      Infectivity titers derived from pathogen loads were compared to published PRT
      log10 reduction factors (LRF); LRFs were also reviewed for Plasmodium and T.
      cruzi. The potential positive impact on donor retention following removal of
      deferrals from required questioning and testing for WNV, Babesia, Plasmodium, and
      T. cruzi was estimated for American Red Cross (ARC) donors. RESULTS: A/UVA and
      S-303/GSH reduced infectivity to levels in accordance with those recognized by
      FDA as suitable to replace testing for all agents evaluated. If PRT replaced
      deferrals resulting from health history questions and/or NAT for WNV, Babesia,
      Plasmodium, and T. cruzi, 27,758 ARC donors could be retained allowing
      approximately 50,000 additional donations/year based on 1.79 donations/donor for 
      calendar year 2019 (extrapolated to an estimated 125,000 additional donations
      nationally). CONCLUSION: Pathogen loads in donations from US blood donors
      demonstrated that robust PRT may provide an opportunity to replace deferrals
      associated with donor questioning and NAT for vector-borne agents allowing for
      significant donor retention and likely increased blood availability.

TI  - Systematic Review of the Serotonergic System in the Pathophysiology of Severe
      Dengue: The Theory of Thrombocytopenia and Vascular Extravasation.
LID - 10.2174/1389557522666220619231643 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe dengue is characterized by thrombocytopenia, hemorrhaging,
      and/or capillary extravasation, and may be linked to a reduced plasma
      concentration of serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine, or 5-HT). OBJECTIVE: The aim of 
      the current contribution was to conduct a systematic bibliographic review of
      reports on the role of the peripheral serotonergic system in the pathophysiology 
      of severe dengue. METHODS: A bibliographic review was carried out of in vivo/in
      vitro models, clinical trials, and case series studies from 2010-2019. The
      selective criteria were the use of treatments with serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      and/or agonists/antagonists of 5-HT receptors, and their impact on inflammation, 
      coagulation, and the endothelium. Also included were cross-sectional and cohort
      studies on the relationship between intraplatelet and plasma 5-HT levels in
      patients with dengue. The risk of bias in the selected reports was examined with 
      domain-based assessment utilizing Cochrane-type criteria. The main results are
      summarized in tables and figures. RESULTS: Based on descriptions of the effect of
      serotonergic drugs on 5-HT levels and the findings of clinical trials of dengue
      treatment, most receptors of the peripheral serotonergic system, and especially
      5-HT2A, seem to participate in regulating serum 5-HT during severe dengue.
      Therefore, the peripheral serotonergic system probably contributes to
      thrombocytopenia and capillary extravasation. CONCLUSION: Regarding dengue, 5-HT 
      may be a key parameter for predicting severity, and an understanding of
      5-HT-related mechanisms could possibly facilitate the development of new
      therapies. These proposals require further research due to the limited number of 
      publications on the role of serotonergic receptors at the peripheral level.

TI  - Review of the ecology and behaviour of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in
      Western Africa and implications for vector control.

AB  - Western Africa is vulnerable to arboviral disease transmission, having recently
      experienced major outbreaks of chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika.
      However, there have been relatively few studies on the natural history of the two
      major human arbovirus vectors in this region, Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus,
      potentially limiting the implementation of effective vector control. We
      systematically searched for and reviewed relevant studies on the behaviour and
      ecology of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in Western Africa, published over the
      last 40 years. We identified 73 relevant studies, over half of which were
      conducted in Nigeria, Senegal, or Cote d'Ivoire. Most studies investigated the
      ecology of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, exploring the impact of seasonality
      and land cover on mosquito populations and identifying aquatic habitats. This
      review highlights the adaptation of Ae. albopictus to urban environments and its 
      invasive potential, and the year-round maintenance of Ae. aegypti populations in 
      water storage containers. However, important gaps were identified in the
      literature on the behaviour of both species, particularly Ae. albopictus. In
      Western Africa, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus appear to be mainly anthropophilic
      and to bite predominantly during the day, but further research is needed to
      confirm this to inform planning of effective vector control strategies. We
      discuss the public health implications of these findings and comment on the
      suitability of existing and novel options for control in Western Africa.

TI  - N(6)-methyladenosine modification of the Aedes aegypti transcriptome and its
      alteration upon dengue virus infection in Aag2 cell line.
PG  - 607
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03566-8 [doi]
AB  - The N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification of RNA has been reported to affect 
      viral infections. Studies have confirmed the role of m(6)A in replication of
      several vector-borne flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), in mammalian
      cells. Here, we explored the role of m(6)A in DENV replication in the mosquito
      Aedes aegypti Aag2 cell line. We first determined the presence of m(6)A on the
      RNAs from mosquito cells and using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation and
      sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) identified m(6)A modification of the mosquito
      transcriptome and those that changed upon DENV infection. Depletion of m(6)A
      methyltransferases and the m(6)A binding protein YTHDF3 RNAs decreased the
      replication of DENV. In particular, we found that the Ae. aegypti ubiquitin
      carrier protein 9 (Ubc9) is m(6)A modified and its expression increases after
      DENV infection. Silencing of the gene and ectopic expression of Ubc9 led to
      reduced and increased DENV replication, respectively. The abundance of Ubc9 mRNA 
      and its stability were reduced with the inhibition of m(6)A modification,
      implying that m(6)A modification of Ubc9 might enhance expression of the gene. We
      also show that the genome of DENV is m(6)A modified at five sites in mosquito
      cells. Altogether, this work reveals the involvement of m(6)A modification in Ae.
      aegypti-DENV interaction.

TI  - Animal venoms as a source of antiviral peptides active against arboviruses: a
      systematic review.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05494-8 [doi]
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as Zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya
      virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and West Nile virus
      (WNV), are pathogens of global importance. Therefore, there has been an
      increasing need for new drugs for the treatment of these viral infections. In
      this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) obtained from animal venoms stand out
      as promising compounds because they exhibit strong antiviral activity against
      emerging arboviral pathogens. Thus, we systematically searched and critically
      analyzed in vitro and in vivo studies that evaluated the anti-arbovirus effect of
      peptide derivatives from toxins produced by vertebrates and invertebrates.
      Thirteen studies that evaluated the antiviral action of 10 peptides against
      arboviruses were included in this review. The peptides were derived from the
      venom of scorpions, spiders, wasps, snakes, sea snails, and frogs and were tested
      against DENV, ZIKV, YFV, WNV, and CHIKV. Despite the high structural variety of
      the peptides included in this study, their antiviral activity appears to be
      associated with the presence of positive charges, an excess of basic amino acids 
      (mainly lysine), and a high isoelectric point (above 8). These peptides use
      different antiviral mechanisms, the most common of which is the inhibition of
      viral replication, release, entry, or fusion. Moreover, peptides with virucidal
      and cytoprotective (pre-treatment) effects were also identified. In conclusion,
      animal-venom-derived peptides stand out as a promising alternative in the search 
      and development of prototype antivirals against arboviruses.

AB  - Dengue fever modelling in endemic locations is critical to reducing outbreaks and
      improving vector-borne illness control. Early projections of dengue are a crucial
      tool for disease control because of the unavailability of treatments and
      universal vaccination. Neural networks have made significant contributions to
      public health in a variety of ways. In this paper, we develop a deep learning
      modelling using random forest (RF) that helps extract the features of the dengue 
      fever from the text datasets. The proposed modelling involves the data
      collection, preprocessing of the input texts, and feature extraction. The
      extracted features are studied to test how well the feature extraction using RF
      is effective on dengue datasets. The simulation result shows that the proposed
      method achieves higher degree of accuracy that offers an improvement of more than
      12% than the existing methods in extracting the features from the input datasets 
      than the other feature extraction methods. Further, the study reduces the errors 
      associated with feature extraction that is 10% lesser than the other existing
      methods, and this shows the efficacy of the model.

      (Diptera: Culicidae) for Dengue and Chikungunya Viruses.
PG  - 876400
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.876400 [doi]
AB  - Effective control strategies against arthropod disease vectors are amongst the
      most powerful tools to prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases. The sterile
      insect technique (SIT) is an effective and sustainable autocidal control method
      that has recently shown effective population suppression against different Aedes 
      vector species worldwide. The SIT approach for mosquito vectors requires the
      release of radio-sterilized male mosquitoes only, but currently available sex
      separation techniques cannot ensure the complete elimination of females resulting
      in short-term risk of increased biting rate and arboviral disease transmission.
      In this study, we compared for the first time the transmission of dengue and
      chikungunya viruses in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus females exposed as
      pupae to an irradiation dose of 40 Gy. Females of both species were fed on blood 
      spiked with either dengue or chikungunya viruses, and body parts were tested for 
      virus presence by real-time RT-PCR at different time points. No differences were 
      observed in the dissemination efficiency of the dengue virus in irradiated and
      unirradiated Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. The dissemination of the 
      chikungunya virus was higher in Ae. albopictus than in Ae. Aegypti, and
      irradiation increased the virus load in both species. However, we did not observe
      differences in the transmission efficiency for chikungunya (100%) and dengue
      (8-27%) between mosquito species, and irradiation did not impact
      transmissibility. Further implications of these results on the epidemiology of
      vector-borne diseases in the field are discussed.

TI  - Diagnosis of dengue virus infection using spectroscopic images and deep learning.
PG  - e985
LID - 10.7717/peerj-cs.985 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection is one of the major health issues and a substantial
      epidemic infectious human disease. More than two billion humans are living in
      dengue susceptible regions with annual infection mortality rate is about 5%-20%. 
      At initial stages, it is difficult to differentiate dengue virus symptoms with
      other similar diseases. The main objective of this research is to diagnose dengue
      virus infection in human blood sera for better treatment and rehabilitation
      process. A novel and robust approach is proposed based on Raman spectroscopy and 
      deep learning. In this regard, the ResNet101 deep learning model is modified by
      exploiting transfer learning (TL) concept on Raman spectroscopic data of human
      blood sera. Sample size was selected using standard statistical tests. The
      proposed model is evaluated on 2,000 Raman spectra images in which 1,200 are
      DENV-infected of human blood sera samples, and 800 are healthy ones. It offers
      96.0% accuracy on testing data for DENV infection diagnosis. Moreover, the
      developed approach demonstrated minimum improvement of 6.0% and 7.0% in terms of 
      AUC and Kappa index respectively over the other state-of-the-art techniques. The 
      developed model offers superior performance to capture minute Raman spectral
      variations due to the better residual learning capability and generalization
      ability compared to others deep learning models. The developed model revealed
      that it might be applied for diagnosis of DENV infection to save precious human
      lives.

AB  - Tetradenia riparia Hochsteter codd. (Lamiaceae) in its native African continent, 
      is considered one of the most popular aromatic medicinal plants. In folk medicine
      it may be used as an infusion to treat respiratory problems, cough, headache,
      stomach pain, diarrhea, fever, malaria, and dengue; and in the form of compresses
      it is applied for the relief of headaches and toothaches. The species T. riparia 
      has been researched for decades to isolate and identify chemical constituents
      present in extracts or essential oil obtained from the leaves, floral buds, or
      stems of this plant. The present study reviews the scientific literature on
      ethnomedicinal, phytochemical, and pharmacological aspects of T. riparia. We
      discuss issues related to the botanical and geographical description of the
      species, ethnobotanical uses, phytochemical studies on its essential oil and
      extracts, and biological activities of T. riparia. Several compounds have already
      been isolated from leaves, such as ibozol, 7alpha-hydroxyroileanone,
      1',2'-dideacetylboronolide, 8(14),15-sandaracopimaradiene-7alpha,18-diol;
      5,6-dihydro-alpha-pyrone and alpha-pyrone. Terpenes predominated in the essential
      oil, comprising monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, hydrocarbons, and
      oxygenates. Most phytocompounds were isolated from the leaves and flower buds,
      namely fenchone, 14-hydroxy-9-epi (E)-caryophyllene, 9beta,
      13beta-epoxy-7-abietene, and 6,7-dehydroroileanone. These compounds provide the
      species a high pharmacological potential, with antimicrobial, antioxidant,
      antitumor, analgesic, anti-leishmania, anti-tuberculosis, and anti-parasitic
      activities. Therefore, this species is a promising herbal medicine.

PG  - 2145

AB  - Dengue is now a major health concern in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the
      influence of local meteorological factors on the incidence of dengue is an
      important element for better prediction and control of this disease. This study
      aims to assess the impact of meteorological factors on dengue transmission in the
      central region of Burkina Faso. We analyzed the lagged effects of meteorological 
      factors on the weekly incidence of dengue from 2017 to 2019 in the central region
      of Burkina Faso using a General Additive Model. The results show that maximum and
      minimum temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed have a significant
      non-linear effect on dengue cases in the region with 83% of case variance
      explained. The optimal temperature that increases dengue cases was 27 degrees C
      to 32 degrees C for the maximum temperature and 18 degrees C to 20 degrees C for 
      the minimum temperature with a decrease beyond that. The maximum temperature
      shifted by six weeks had the best correlation with dengue incidence. The
      estimated number of dengue cases increases as the maximum relative humidity
      increases from 15 to 45% and then from 60 to 70%. In general, an increase in
      daily wind speed is estimated to decrease the number of daily dengue cases. The
      relationship between rainfall and dengue cases was not significant. This study
      provides local information about the effect of meteorological factors on dengue
      that should help improve predictive models of dengue cases in Burkina Faso and
      contribute to the control of this disease.

      Systematic Review.
PG  - 900077
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.900077 [doi]
AB  - Arboviruses are a group of diseases that are transmitted by an arthropod vector. 
      Since they are part of the Neglected Tropical Diseases that pose several public
      health challenges for countries around the world. The arboviruses' dynamics are
      governed by a combination of climatic, environmental, and human mobility factors.
      Arboviruses prediction models can be a support tool for decision-making by public
      health agents. In this study, we propose a systematic literature review to
      identify arboviruses prediction models, as well as models for their transmitter
      vector dynamics. To carry out this review, we searched reputable scientific bases
      such as IEE Xplore, PubMed, Science Direct, Springer Link, and Scopus. We search 
      for studies published between the years 2015 and 2020, using a search string. A
      total of 429 articles were returned, however, after filtering by exclusion and
      inclusion criteria, 139 were included. Through this systematic review, it was
      possible to identify the challenges present in the construction of arboviruses
      prediction models, as well as the existing gap in the construction of
      spatiotemporal models.

AB  - HELLP is a syndrome characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low
      platelets. It is a rare complication of pregnancy and is usually associated with 
      pre-eclampsia. However, 10-20% cases of HELLP can present without hypertension.
      Dengue fever is an arboviral-borne tropical illness that is characterized with
      fever, thrombocytopenia, and bleeding manifestations. We present a case of a
      primigravida with HELLP syndrome masquerading in the background of dengue fever. 
      Unique features to this case report include delayed presentation of HELLP
      syndrome with normotension which can have overlapping features with dengue fever,
      especially in term pregnancy. This case highlights the need of strict vigilance
      in cases of dengue fever with pregnancy. How to cite this article: Patnaik R,

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus mainly transmitted by mosquitos of the genus
      Aedes. The first cases of ZIKV infection in South America occurred in Brazil in
      2015. The infection in humans causes diverse symptoms from asymptomatic to a
      syndrome-like dengue infection with fever, arthralgia, and myalgia. Furthermore, 
      ZIKV infection during pregnancy is associated with fetal microcephaly and
      neurological disorders. The identification of host molecular mechanisms
      responsible for the modulation of different signaling pathways in response to
      ZIKV is the first step to finding potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets
      and understanding disease outcomes. In the last decade, it has been shown that
      microRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators involved in
      virtually all cellular processes. miRNAs present in body fluids can not only
      serve as key biomarkers for diagnostics and prognosis of human disorders but also
      contribute to cellular signaling offering new insights into pathological
      mechanisms. Here, we describe for the first time ZIKV-induced changes in miRNA
      plasma levels in patients during the acute and recovery phases of infection. We
      observed that during ZIKV acute infection, among the dysregulated miRNAs (DMs),
      the majority is with decreased levels when compared to convalescent and control
      patients. We used systems biology tools to build and highlight biological
      interactions between miRNAs and their multiple direct and indirect target
      molecules. Among the 24 DMs identified in ZIKV + patients, miR-146, miR-125a-5p, 
      miR-30-5p, and miR-142-3p were related to signaling pathways modulated during
      infection and immune response. The results presented here are an effort to open
      new vistas for the key roles of miRNAs during ZIKV infection.

AB  - Biological control is one of the methods available for control of Aedes aegypti
      populations. We used experimental microcosms to evaluate the effects of actual
      predation and predation risk by dragonfly larvae (Odonata) on larval development,
      adult longevity, and adult size of Ae. aegypti. We used six treatments: control, 
      removal, variable density cues (Cues VD), fixed density cues (Cues FD), variable 
      density predator (Predator VD), and fixed density predator (Predator FD) (n = 5
      each). Predator treatments received one dragonfly larva. Cue treatments were
      composed of crushed Ae. aegypti larvae released into the microcosm. For the FD
      treatments, we maintained a larval density of 200 individuals. The average
      mortality of Ae. aegypti larvae in the Predator VD treatment was used as the
      standard mortality for the other treatments. Mosquitoes from the Predator VD and 
      Cues VD treatments developed faster, and adults were larger and had greater
      longevity compared to all other treatments, likely due to the higher food
      availability from larval density reduction. High larval density negatively
      affected larval developmental time, adult size, and longevity. Males were less
      sensitive to density-dependent effects. Results from this study suggest that the 
      presence of predators may lead to the emergence of adult mosquitoes with greater 
      fitness, causing an overall positive effect on Ae. aegypti population growth
      rates.

      combinations.
PG  - 41
LID - 10.1186/s40360-022-00580-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has claimed millions of lives and devastated the
      health service system, livelihood, and economy in many countries worldwide.
      Despite the vaccination programs in many countries, the spread of the pandemic
      continues, and effective treatment is still urgently needed. Although some
      antiviral drugs have been shown to be effective, they are not widely available.
      Repurposing of anti-parasitic drugs with in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is a
      promising approach being tested in many clinical trials. Combination of these
      drugs is a plausible way to enhance their effectiveness. METHODS: The in vitro
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of combinations of niclosamide, ivermectin and
      chloroquine were evaluated in Vero E6 and lung epithelial cells, Calu-3. RESULTS:
      All the two-drug combinations showed higher potency resulting in up to 4-fold
      reduction in the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values compared to 
      individual drugs. Among these combinations, niclosamide-ivermectin achieved the
      highest inhibitory level of over 99%. Combination synergy analysis showed
      niclosamide-ivermectin combination to have the best synergy score with a mean
      Loewe synergy score of 4.28 and a peak synergy score of 24.6 in Vero E6 cells and
      a mean Loewe synergy score of 3.82 and a peak synergy score of 10.86 in Calu-3
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the benefit of drug
      combinations on anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Niclosamide and ivermectin showed the
      best synergistic profile and should be further tested in clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute febrile illness is a common presentation for patients at
      hospitals globally. Assays that can diagnose a variety of common pathogens in
      blood could help to establish a diagnosis for targeted disease management. We
      aimed to evaluate the performance of the BioFire Global Fever Panel (GF Panel), a
      multiplex nucleic acid amplification test performed on whole blood specimens run 
      on the BioFire FilmArray System, in the diagnosis of several pathogens that cause
      acute febrile illness. METHODS: We did a prospective, multicentre,
      cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study to evaluate the GF Panel. Consenting
      adults and children older than 6 months presenting with fever in the previous 2
      days were enrolled consecutively in sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania,
      Uganda), southeast Asia (Cambodia, Thailand), central and South America
      (Honduras, Peru), and the USA (Washington, DC; St Louis, MO). We assessed the
      performance of six analytes (chikungunya virus, dengue virus [serotypes 1-4],
      Leptospira spp, Plasmodium spp, Plasmodium falciparum, and Plasmodium vivax or
      Plasmodium ovale) on the GF Panel. The performance of the GF Panel was assessed
      using comparator PCR assays with different primers followed by bidirectional
      sequencing on nucleic acid extracts from the same specimen. We calculated the
      positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of the GF Panel with
      respect to the comparator assays. This study is registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02968355. FINDINGS: From March 26, 2018, to Sept 30, 2019,
      1965 participants were enrolled at ten sites worldwide. Of the 1875 participants 
      with analysable results, 980 (52.3%) were female and the median age was 22 years 
      (range 0-100). At least one analyte was detected in 657 (35.0%) of 1875
      specimens. The GF Panel had a positive percent agreement for the six analytes
      evaluated as follows: chikungunya virus 100% (95% CI 86.3-100), dengue virus
      94.0% (90.6-96.5), Leptospira spp 93.8% (69.8-99.8), Plasmodium spp 98.3%
      (96.3-99.4), P falciparum 92.7% (88.8-95.6), and P vivax or P ovale 92.7%
      (86.7-96.6). The GF Panel had a negative percent agreement equal to or greater
      than 99.2% (98.6-99.6) for all analytes. INTERPRETATION: This 1 h
      sample-to-answer, molecular device can detect common causative agents of acute
      febrile illness with excellent positive percent agreement and negative percent
      agreement directly in whole blood. The targets of the assay are prevalent in
      tropical and subtropical regions globally, and the assay could help to provide
      both public health surveillance and individual diagnoses. FUNDING: BioFire

AB  - BACKGROUND: Encephalitis is a worldwide public health issue, with a substantially
      high burden among children in southeast Asia. We aimed to determine the causes of
      encephalitis in children admitted to hospitals across the Greater Mekong region
      by implementing a comprehensive state-of-the-art diagnostic procedure harmonised 
      across all centres, and identifying clinical characteristics related to patients'
      conditions. METHODS: In this multicentre, observational, prospective study of
      childhood encephalitis, four referral hospitals in Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and
      Myanmar recruited children (aged 28 days to 16 years) who presented with altered 
      mental status lasting more than 24 h and two of the following minor criteria:
      fever (within the 72 h before or after presentation), one or more generalised or 
      partial seizures (excluding febrile seizures), a new-onset focal neurological
      deficit, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell count of 5 per mL or higher, 
      or brain imaging (CT or MRI) suggestive of lesions of encephalitis. Comprehensive
      diagnostic procedures were harmonised across all centres, with first-line testing
      was done on samples taken at inclusion and results delivered within 24 h of
      inclusion for main treatable causes of disease and second-line testing was done
      thereafter for mostly non-treatable causes. An independent expert medical panel
      reviewed the charts and attribution of causes of all the included children. Using
      multivariate analyses, we assessed risk factors associated with unfavourable
      outcomes (ie, severe neurological sequelae and death) at discharge using data
      from baseline and day 2 after inclusion. This study is registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04089436, and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between July 28, 
      2014, and Dec 31, 2017, 664 children with encephalitis were enrolled. Median age 
      was 4.3 years (1.8-8.8), 295 (44%) children were female, and 369 (56%) were male.
      A confirmed or probable cause of encephalitis was identified in 425 (64%)
      patients: 216 (33%) of 664 cases were due to Japanese encephalitis virus, 27 (4%)
      were due to dengue virus, 26 (4%) were due to influenza virus, 24 (4%) were due
      to herpes simplex virus 1, 18 (3%) were due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 17
      (3%) were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, 17 (3%) were due to enterovirus A71,
      74 (9%) were due to other pathogens, and six (1%) were due to autoimmune
      encephalitis. Diagnosis was made within 24 h of admission to hospital for 83
      (13%) of 664 children. 119 (18%) children had treatable conditions and 276 (42%) 
      had conditions that could have been preventable by vaccination. At time of
      discharge, 153 (23%) of 664 children had severe neurological sequelae and 83
      (13%) had died. In multivariate analyses, risk factors for unfavourable outcome
      were diagnosis of M tuberculosis infection upon admission (odds ratio 3.23 [95%
      CI 1.04-10.03]), coma on day 2 (2.90 [1.78-4.72]), supplementary oxygen
      requirement (1.89 [1.25-2.86]), and more than 1 week duration between symptom
      onset and admission to hospital (3.03 [1.68-5.48]). At 1 year after inclusion, of
      432 children who were discharged alive from hospital with follow-up data, 24 (5%)
      had died, 129 (30%) had neurological sequelae, and 279 (65%) had completely
      recovered. INTERPRETATION: In southeast Asia, most causes of childhood
      encephalitis are either preventable or treatable, with Japanese encephalitis
      virus being the most common cause. We provide crucial information that could
      guide public health policy to improve diagnostic, vaccination, and early
      therapeutic guidelines on childhood encephalitis in the Greater Mekong region.

PG  - 2079323
LID - 10.1080/21645515.2022.2079323 [doi]
AB  - Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that have been recently
      considered among the significant public health problems in defined geographical
      regions. In this line, there have been vaccines approved for some flaviviruses
      including dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever
      virus (YFV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), although the efficiency of
      such vaccines thought to be questionable. Surprisingly, there are no effective
      vaccine for many other hazardous flaviviruses, including West Nile and Zika
      viruses. Furthermore, in spite of approved vaccines for some flaviviruses, for
      example DENV, alternative prophylactic vaccines seem to be still needed for the
      protection of a broader population, and it originates from the unsatisfying
      safety, and the efficacy of vaccines that have been introduced. Thus, adenovirus 
      vector-based vaccine candidates are suggested to be effective, safe, and
      reliable. Interestingly, recent widespread use of adenovirus vector-based
      vaccines for the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the importance and
      feasibility of their widespread application. In this review, the applicability of
      adenovirus vector-based vaccines, as promising approaches to harness the diseases
      caused by Flaviviruses, is discussed.

      and Future Directions.
PG  - 884645

AB  - Climate change is unexpected weather patterns that can create an alarming
      situation. Due to climate change, various sectors are affected, and one of the
      sectors is healthcare. As a result of climate change, the geographic range of
      several vector-borne human infectious diseases will expand. Currently, dengue is 
      taking its toll, and climate change is one of the key reasons contributing to the
      intensification of dengue disease transmission. The most important climatic
      factors linked to dengue transmission are temperature, rainfall, and relative
      humidity. The present study carries out a systematic literature review on the
      surveillance system to predict dengue outbreaks based on Machine Learning
      modeling techniques. The systematic literature review discusses the methodology
      and objectives, the number of studies carried out in different regions and
      periods, the association between climatic factors and the increase in positive
      dengue cases. This study also includes a detailed investigation of meteorological
      data, the dengue positive patient data, and the pre-processing techniques used
      for data cleaning. Furthermore, correlation techniques in several studies to
      determine the relationship between dengue incidence and meteorological parameters
      and machine learning models for predictive analysis are discussed. In the future 
      direction for creating a dengue surveillance system, several research challenges 
      and limitations of current work are discussed.

      DENV Serotypes.
PG  - 892990
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.892990 [doi]
AB  - A panoramic analysis of chemokines, pro-inflammatory/regulatory cytokines, and
      growth factors was performed in serum samples from patients with acute DENV
      infection (n=317) by a high-throughput microbeads array. Most soluble mediators
      analyzed were increased in DENV patients regardless of the DENV serotype. The
      substantial increase (>/=10-fold) of CXCL10, IL-6, and IFN-gamma, and decreased
      levels of PDGF (<0.4-fold) was universally identified in all DENV serotypes. Of
      note, increased levels of CXCL8, CCL4, and IL-12 (>/=3-9-fold) were selectively
      observed in DENV2 as compared to DENV1 and DENV4. Heatmap and biomarker
      signatures further illustrated the massive release of soluble mediators observed 
      in DENV patients, confirming the marked increase of several soluble mediators in 
      DENV2. Integrative correlation matrices and networks showed that DENV infection
      exhibited higher connectivity among soluble mediators. Of note, DENV2 displayed a
      more complex network, with higher connectivity involving a higher number of
      soluble mediators. The timeline kinetics (Day 0-1, D2, D3, D4-6) analysis
      additionally demonstrated differences among DENV serotypes. While DENV1 triggers 
      a progressive increase of soluble mediators towards D3 and with a decline at
      D4-6, DENV2 and DENV4 develop with a progressive increase towards D4-6 with an
      early plateau observed in DENV4. Overall, our results provided a comprehensive
      overview of the immune response elicited by DENV infection, revealing that
      infection with distinct DENV serotypes causes distinct profiles, rhythms, and
      dynamic network connectivity of soluble mediators. Altogether, these findings may
      provide novel insights to understand the pathogenesis of acute infection with
      distinct DENV serotypes.

AB  - Dengue, a vector-borne disease remains as one of the most serious public health
      problems globally. Incidence of this disease is on an increasing trend and
      currently over a billion people in tropical and subtropical regions are at risk. 
      In the absence of an operational vaccine, prevention of dengue virus (DENV) is
      primarily focused upon controlling mosquito vectors. Mosquito vector surveillance
      programmes require simple and rapid tools to detect mosquitoes infected with
      DENV. Here, we tested the commercially available DENV Detect NS1 ELISA kit
      (InBios International, Inc.) for detection of recombinant DENV-NS1 protein in
      Aedes mosquito samples. The kit was evaluated to find out the minimum detection
      limit of recombinant DENV-2 NS1 protein following the manufacturer's
      instructions. Initially, the NS1 protein detection threshold of the kit was
      determined and later the assay was standardized for detection of NS1 protein in
      Aedes aegypti mosquito pools containing 5, 10 and 25 mosquitoes. The ELISA kit
      displayed high sensitivity towards detection of recombinant dengue virus-2 NS1
      protein in mosquito pools (up to 25 mosquitoes per pool) at 25 pico gram
      concentration. Since the commercial NS1 ELISA is highly sensitive and follows a
      very simple procedure, it could be employed for DENV surveillance in Aedes
      aegypti mosquitoes, after carrying out laboratory and field bioassays with DENV
      infected specimens.

TI  - Laboratory evaluation of the efficacy of boric acid containing toxic sugar baits 
      against Anopheles culicifacies, An. stephensi and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
PG  - 52-56
LID - 10.4103/0972-9062.331414 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Attractive toxic sugar baits (ATSB) is a novel tool
      which employs mosquito sugar feeding behaviour to kill them. The potential of
      ATSB against mosquito vectors has been demonstrated in limited scope around the
      world including Israel, some of the African countries and USA. But their efficacy
      against mosquito vectors of India is yet to be ascertained. Therefore, current
      study was planned to evaluate the efficacy of TSB (without attractant) against
      two important malaria vectors Anopheles culicifacies and An. stephensi along with
      major dengue vector Aedes aegypti. METHODS: TSB solution was prepared by
      dissolving different concentrations of boric acid in glucose and tested against
      each of the mosquito species. Another experiment was done by spraying this boric 
      acid sugar solution on to Calendula officinalis plant. It served as a sole source
      of mosquito feed and mortality of mosquitoes was counted after 24 hours. RESULTS:
      The TSB resulted in 100% mortality of Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi at 4%
      concentration of boric acid while in An. culicifacies 100% mortality was achieved
      at 3% concentration TSB solution. TSB solution with 2% boric acid, resulted in
      99.1% mortality in An. culicifacies while ~95 % mortality of An. stephensi and
      Ae. aegypti. When TSB solution with 2% boric acid was sprayed on plant, ~89-94%
      mortality was observed in both An. stephensi and An. culicifacies. INTERPRETATION
      & CONCLUSION: Based on the results, boric acid based toxic sugar bait solution
      could be a promising tool for vector control. Further studies are needed to find 
      out its toxicity of TSB against non-target organisms and residual efficacy in
      field trials in different ecotypes.

      patients.

LID - 10.1080/20477724.2022.2088465 [doi]
AB  - Circulating hsa-miRNA-126 (CmiR-126) has been reported to involve in the
      pathogenesis of many infectious diseases including dengue virus infection.
      However, no prior study has been conducted to describe more details in
      dengue-infected pediatric patients. This study aimed to describe CmiR-126-3p in
      dengue-infected pediatric patients during the febrile and convalescent phases.
      Additionally, the correlations between CmiR-126-3p and other relevant clinical
      laboratory factors were investigated. Sixty paired-serum specimens collected
      during febrile and convalescent phases were retrieved from patients with dengue
      fever (DF) (n = 30) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (n = 30). Thirty
      paired-serum specimens collected from non-dengue acute febrile illness patients
      (AFI) were included as the control group. CmiR-126-3p was determined using
      reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase-chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
      Relative miRNA expression was calculated as 2(-DeltaCt) using CmiR-16-5p for data
      normalization. CmiR-126-3p expression during febrile and convalescent phases in
      dengue-infected patients was significantly lower than AFI (p < 0.05). However,
      miRNA levels were not different (p > 0.05) compared between DF and DHF and
      between primary and secondary infection. CmiR-126-3p levels in DF in the
      convalescent were significantly higher than in the febrile phase (p = 0.025). No 
      association between CmiR-126-3p and hematocrit, WBC level, platelet count, WBC
      differential count or dengue viral load was observed (p > 0.05). The data suggest
      that hsa-miR-126-3p involved in pathogenesis of dengue infection and may be a
      promising early and late biomarker for DENV infection. However, hsa-miR-126-3p
      alone cannot be used as a predictor for dengue severity.

TI  - A gossypol derivative effectively protects against Zika and dengue virus
      infection without toxicity.
PG  - 143
LID - 10.1186/s12915-022-01344-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) cause microcephaly and
      dengue hemorrhagic fever, respectively, leading to severe problems. No effective 
      antiviral agents are approved against infections of these flaviviruses, calling
      for the need to develop potent therapeutics. We previously identified gossypol as
      an effective inhibitor against ZIKV and DENV infections, but this compound is
      toxic and not suitable for in vivo treatment. RESULTS: In this study, we showed
      that gossypol derivative ST087010 exhibited potent and broad-spectrum in vitro
      inhibitory activity against infections of at least ten ZIKV strains isolated from
      different hosts, time periods, and countries, as well as DENV-1-4 serotypes, and 
      significantly reduced cytotoxicity compared to gossypol. It presented
      broad-spectrum in vivo protective efficacy, protecting ZIKV-infected Ifnar1(-/-) 
      mice from lethal challenge, with increased survival and reduced weight loss.
      Ifnar1(-/-) mice treated with this gossypol derivative decreased viral titers in 
      various tissues, including the brain and testis, after infection with ZIKV at
      different human isolates. Moreover, ST087010 potently blocked ZIKV vertical
      transmission in pregnant Ifnar1(-/-) mice, preventing ZIKV-caused fetal death,
      and it was safe for pregnant mice and their pups. It also protected
      DENV-2-challenged Ifnar1(-/-) mice against viral replication by reducing the
      viral titers in the brain, kidney, heart, and sera. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our
      data indicate the potential for further development of this gossypol derivative
      as an effective and safe broad-spectrum therapeutic agent to treat ZIKV and DENV 
      diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (MIOC) is one of the first
      scientific journals created in Brazil and currently one of the most important
      biomedical journals in South America. Knowledge of the main themes disseminated
      over time and its main contributors can contribute towards a better understanding
      of its trajectory and future. OBJECTIVES: Map the journal's scientific
      publication between 1909 and 2020. METHODS: Data from three scientific databases 
      was combined, alongside bibliometrics and network analysis to analyse publication
      records between 1909 and 2020. FINDINGS: Publications increased substantially
      since the 1980s. The main publishing organisations are Brazilian. Excluding
      Brazil, the main publishing countries are the USA, Argentina, and Colombia.
      During the entire investigated period, the main themes refer to Chagas disease,
      schistosomiasis, and Leishmaniasis. During some periods, publications followed
      disease outbreaks in Brazil (e.g., dengue fever and yellow fever). MAIN
      CONCLUSIONS: Since its foundation in 1909, the MIOC has focused on infectious and
      parasitic diseases. The editorial changes implemented from the 1980s onwards led 
      MIOC to a relevant growth concerning annual publications and its transformation
      into an important communication vehicle for researchers from several Brazilian
      organisations besides Fiocruz, as well as organisations from other countries,
      especially within Latin America.

TI  - Acute Kidney Injury in Dengue Fever: A One-year Hospital-based Prospective
      Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - 11-12
LID - 10.5005/japi-11001-0024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dengue fever is amongst the most cardinal
      arthropod-borne infection among humans. Around the world, an estimated 2.5
      billion individuals are at peril of infection, of which approximately 975 million
      reside in urban areas of tropical and subtropical nations like Southeast Asia,
      the Pacific, and surprisingly Americas. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is so far not a
      well-studied dengue complication. The renal abnormalities, though not common, are
      AKI, proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, and hemolytic uraemic syndrome, which are
      considered complications of the disease. This study was designed to evaluate the 
      prevalence of AKI in DF and find out the predictors of the development of AKI in 
      patients with DI. METHODOLOGY: This one-year hospital-based cross-sectional study
      was performed in the Department of General Medicine, Maharishi Markandeshwar
      Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Mullana, Ambala from March 2020 to
      April 2021. A total of 120 eligible patients with DI were enrolled. These
      patients were evaluated for AKI based on acute kidney injury network (AKIN)
      criteria. RESULTS: The majority of the patients were males 57.5% and the male to 
      female ratio was 1.35:1. Most of the patients were aged between 31 and 50 years
      (40.8%) and the mean age was 42.23 +/- 16.28 years. The majority of the patients 
      (72.5%) had DF, 13.3% of the patients had dengue fever with warning signs and
      14.2% of the patients had severe dengue. The prevalence of AKI was 27.5% in
      patients with dengue fever. Other than AKI, Acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS) (11.7%), Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) (3.3%), and sepsis
      (0.8%) were the complications noted. The majority of the patients (83.3%)
      improved and were discharged and mortality was noted in 16.7% of the patients.
      Also, significant differences were noted in patients with and without AKI.

      sulfur and oxygen chalcogens.
LID - 10.2174/0929867329666220610211441 [doi]
AB  - Sulfur and oxygen containing-compounds are a relevant class of derivatives that
      is constantly growing due to their wide range of pharmacological activity,
      including the antiviral one. As a proof of this, there are several FDA approved
      antiviral compounds having sulfur and oxygen in their structures. Among RNA
      viruses, the flavivirus genus (e.g. Dengue, West Nile, Yellow Fever and Zika
      viruses) holds a relevant place within zoonotic pathogens and thus flavivirus
      infections are considered a growing risk for the public health. As a consequence,
      the drug discovery process aimed at identify new anti-flavivirus agents is of
      great relevance and will help to find effective therapies not available yet. One 
      of the most alarming features of flaviviruses is their ability to co-infect the
      host, thus aggravating the symptoms of the disease. Therefore, finding compounds 
      endowed with a broad-spectrum anti-flavivirus activity is now becoming a pressing
      need. In this review, we describe the most promising compounds having both sulfur
      and oxygen in their structures characterized by a broad-spectrum activity against
      different flaviviruses. Furthermore, the synthetic procedures applied for the
      preparation of the described derivatives are also reported. Readers can be
      inspired by the contents of this review to design and synthesize more effective
      anti-flavivirus agents as well as to select viral or host targets to achieve an
      antiviral activity as broad as possible.

TI  - Forecasting the incidence of dengue in Bangladesh-Application of time series
      model.
PG  - e666
LID - 10.1002/hsr2.666 [doi]
AB  - Background: Dengue is an alarming public health concern in terms of its
      preventive and curative measures among people in Bangladesh; moreover, its sudden
      outbreak created a lot of suffering among people in 2018. Considering the greater
      burden of disease in larger epidemic years and the difficulty in understanding
      current and future needs, it is highly needed to address early warning systems to
      control epidemics from the earliest. Objective: The study objective was to select
      the most appropriate model for dengue incidence and using the selected model, the
      authors forecast the future dengue outbreak in Bangladesh. Methods and Materials:
      This study considered a secondary data set of monthly dengue occurrences over the
      period of January 2008 to January 2020. Initially, the authors found the suitable
      model from Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Error, Trend,
      Seasonal (ETS) and Trigonometric seasonality, Box-Cox transformation, ARMA
      errors, Trend and Seasonal (TBATS) models with the help of selected model
      selection criteria and finally employing the selected model make forecasting of
      dengue incidences in Bangladesh. Results: Among ARIMA, ETS, and TBATS models, the
      ARIMA model performs better than others. The Box-Jenkin's procedure is applicable
      here and it is found that the best-selected model to forecast the dengue outbreak
      in the context of Bangladesh is ARIMA (2,1,2). Conclusion: Before establishing a 
      comprehensive plan for future combating strategies, it is vital to understand the
      future scenario of dengue occurrence. With this in mind, the authors aimed to
      select an appropriate model that might predict dengue fever outbreaks in
      Bangladesh. The findings revealed that dengue fever is expected to become more

AB  - The syndromic surveillance of a group of diseases that have similar signs and
      symptoms, a common pathophysiology, and diverse etiology is aimed at rapidly
      detecting the presence of outbreaks which could potentially harm public health.
      This includes not only known outbreaks of infectious origin but also those of
      unknown origin. In patients suspected of having SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, it is
      recommended to consider other etiologies of tropical fever in the differential
      diagnosis when these patients live in or come from endemic areas, as is the case 
      of dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, acute Chagas disease, and rickettsiosis, among
      other endemic diseases. The possibility of SARS-CoV-2/AH1 AH5N1 MERS-CoV
      coinfection with these pathogens should also be considered.

TI  - Disruption of spatiotemporal clustering in dengue cases by wMel Wolbachia in
      Yogyakarta, Indonesia.
PG  - 9890

AB  - Dengue exhibits focal clustering in households and neighborhoods, driven by local
      mosquito population dynamics, human population immunity, and fine scale human and
      mosquito movement. We tested the hypothesis that spatiotemporal clustering of
      homotypic dengue cases is disrupted by introduction of the arbovirus-blocking
      bacterium Wolbachia (wMel-strain) into the Aedes aegypti mosquito population. We 
      analysed 318 serotyped and geolocated dengue cases (and 5921 test-negative
      controls) from a randomized controlled trial in Yogyakarta, Indonesia of wMel
      deployments. We find evidence of spatial clustering up to 300 m among the 265
      dengue cases (3083 controls) in the untreated trial arm. Participant pairs
      enrolled within 30 days and 50 m had a 4.7-fold increase (compared to 95% CI on
      permutation-based null distribution: 0.1, 1.2) in the odds of being homotypic
      (i.e. potentially transmission-related) as compared to pairs occurring at any
      distance. In contrast, we find no evidence of spatiotemporal clustering among the
      53 dengue cases (2838 controls) resident in the wMel-treated arm. Introgression
      of wMel Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti mosquito populations interrupts focal dengue
      virus transmission leading to reduced case incidence; the true intervention
      effect may be greater than the 77% efficacy measured in the primary analysis of
      the Yogyakarta trial.

TI  - Climate variability and Aedes vector indices in the southern Philippines: An
      empirical analysis.
PG  - e0010478
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010478 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vector surveillance is an essential public health tool to aid in the 
      prediction and prevention of mosquito borne diseases. This study compared spatial
      and temporal trends of vector surveillance indices for Aedes vectors in the
      southern Philippines, and assessed potential links between vector indices and
      climate factors. METHODS: We analysed routinely collected larval and pupal
      surveillance data from residential areas of 14 cities and 51 municipalities
      during 2013-2018 (House, Container, Breteau and Pupal Indices), and used linear
      regression to explore potential relationships between vector indices and climate 
      variables (minimum temperature, maximum temperature and precipitation). RESULTS: 
      We found substantial spatial and temporal variation in monthly Aedes vector
      indices between cities during the study period, and no seasonal trend apparent.
      The House (HI), Container (CI) and Breteau (BI) Indices remained at comparable
      levels across most surveys (mean HI = 15, mean CI = 16, mean BI = 24), while the 
      Pupal Productivity Index (PPI) was relatively lower in most months (usually below
      5) except for two main peak periods (mean = 49 overall). A small proportion of
      locations recorded high values across all entomological indices in multiple
      surveys. Each of the vector indices were significantly correlated with one or
      more climate variables when matched to data from the same month or the previous 1
      or 2 months, although the effect sizes were small. Significant associations were 
      identified between minimum temperature and HI, CI and BI in the same month (R2 = 
      0.038, p = 0.007; R2 = 0.029, p = 0.018; and R2 = 0.034, p = 0.011,
      respectively), maximum temperature and PPI with a 2-month lag (R2 = 0.031, p =
      0.032), and precipitation and HI in the same month (R2 = 0.023, p = 0.04).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that larval and pupal surveillance indices
      were highly variable, were regularly above the threshold for triggering vector
      control responses, and that vector indices based on household surveys were weakly
      yet significantly correlated with city-level climate variables. We suggest that
      more detailed spatial and temporal analyses of entomological, climate,
      socio-environmental and Aedes-borne disease incidence data are necessary to
      ascertain the most effective use of entomological indices in guiding vector
      control responses, and reduction of human disease risk.

TI  - Dengue virus transovarial transmission detection in Aedes aegypti from dengue

PG  - 1149-1153
LID - 10.14202/vetworld.2022.1149-1153 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aim: To effectively control dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), it is 
      necessary to assess the risk of vertical virus transmission in Aedes aegypti
      mosquitoes. This study aimed to detect dengue virus (DENV) transovarial
      transmission in A. aegypti collected from DHF patients' residences in Denpasar,
      Bali. Materials and Methods: A. aegypti samples were acquired by rearing A.
      aegypti eggs collected from ovitraps placed in the homes of DHF patients.
      Ovitraps were installed for 7 days and viewed using a loupe to determine whether 
      there were Aedes spp. eggs present. An immunocytochemical method was utilized
      with 200 samples, and virus detection was performed using a reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Of the 10 DHF patient 
      houses fitted with ovitraps, four produced positive ovitraps from which larvae
      developed (house index=40%). Of the 50 ovitraps mounted in the 10 homes, 14
      ovitraps were positive and contained A. aegypti eggs (ovitrap index=28%). Of
      these 14 positive ovitraps containing A. aegypti eggs, 10 ovitraps produced
      larvae. Immunocytochemical tests were conducted on A. aegypti eggs from the four 
      houses under study. It was found that from the 200 samples collected, 197 samples
      could be observed, and 11 samples (5.6%) were positive for DENV antigen. RT-PCR
      examination conducted on mosquitoes reared from the four houses studied obtained 
      a negative virus content result. Conclusion: This study found the presence of
      DENV antigen to be as high as 5.6%. This means that potential for transovarial
      transmission exists within DHF patients' homes in Denpasar, Bali. Aedes control
      strategy in Denpasar should address this finding, in addition to the current
      approaches which have focused primarily on the elimination of larval breeding
      habitats and control of adults using insecticidal fogging during outbreaks.

TI  - Anti-Dengue Screening on Several Vietnamese Medicinal Plants: Experimental
      Evidences and Computational Analyses.
PG  - e202101026
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.202101026 [doi]
AB  - Worldwide, medicinal plants have been known for economic and geographical
      advantages, thus possibly holding potentiality against dengue hemorrhagic fever. 
      The methanol/water extracts from different parts of fourteen Vietnam-based plant 
      species were subjected for experimental screening on anti-dengue activity using
      baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21) and plaque reduction neutralisation test
      (PRNT). Firstly, the methanol/water extracts were tested against serotype dengue 
      virus DENV-1. Seven out from nineteen extracts show the PRNT50 values less than
      31.25 mug/mL. Four of the above extracts namely from Euphorbia hirta, Cordyline
      terminalis, Carica papaya, and Elaeagnus latifolia were chosen for testing
      against the serotype DENV-2. All of them exhibit good activity with the PRNT50
      values less than 31.25 mug/ml, which were further fractionated to obtain hexane, 
      ethyl acetate and butanol fractions. Anti-dengue virus activity of the fractions 
      against four serotypes DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4 was evaluated. As results, the ethyl
      acetate fraction of Elaeagnus latifolia is highly active against all four
      serotype viruses. The structural formulae of its nine constituents were input for
      molecular docking simulation. The docking-based order for static inhibitability
      is 6-3L6P>7-3L6P>9-3L6P>2-3L6P>3-3L6P approximately 5-3L6P>9-3L6P>1-3L6P>8-3L6P; 
      QSARIS-based analysis reveals the biocompatibility of the most promising ligands 
      (4-7); ADMET-based analysis expects their pharmacological suitability.
      Exceptional finding on 2-3LKW hydrophilic interaction at Lys43 (with the
      associated Gibbs free energy of -10.3 kcal mol(-1) ) raises an open explanation
      for inhibitory effects. The results encourage further investigations for more
      in-depth mechanisms and drug development, such as in vitro enzyme assays or in
      vitro clinical trials with natural substances from E. latifolia.

TI  - The unreachable doorbells of South Texas: community engagement in colonias on the
      US-Mexico border for mosquito control.
PG  - 1176

AB  - Mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit continue to place millions of people at
      risk of infection around the world. Novel methods of vector control are being
      developed to provide public health officials with the necessary tools to prevent 
      disease transmission and reduce local mosquito populations. However, these
      methods will require public acceptance for a sustainable approach and evaluations
      at local settings. We present our efforts in community engagement carried out in 
      colonias of the Lower Rio Grande Valley in south Texas for mosquito surveillance,
      control, and ecological projects. Along the US-Mexico border the term colonia
      refers to impoverished communities that are usually inhabited by families of
      Hispanic heritage. The different engagements were carried out from September 2016
      to February 2019; during this time, we had three distinct phases for community
      engagement. In Phase 1 we show the initial approach to the colonias in which we
      assessed security and willingness to participate; in Phase 2 we carried out the
      first recruitment procedure involving community meetings and house-to-house
      recruitment; and in Phase 3 we conducted a modified recruitment procedure based
      on community members' input. Our findings show that incorporating community
      members in the development of communication materials and following their
      suggestions for engagement allowed us to generate culturally sensitive
      recruitment materials and to better understand the social relationships and power
      dynamics within these communities. We were able to effectively reach a larger
      portion of the community and decrease the dropout rate of participants. Progress 
      gained with building trust in the communities allowed us to convey participant
      risks and benefits of collaborating with our research projects. Community
      engagement should be viewed as a key component of any local vector control
      program as well as for any scientific research project related to vector control.
      Even in the face of budgetary constraints, small efforts in community engagement 
      go a long way.

TI  - Deep learning models for forecasting dengue fever based on climate data in
      Vietnam.
PG  - e0010509
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010509 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever (DF) represents a significant health burden in Vietnam, 
      which is forecast to worsen under climate change. The development of an
      early-warning system for DF has been selected as a prioritised health adaptation 
      measure to climate change in Vietnam. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop an
      accurate DF prediction model in Vietnam using a wide range of meteorological
      factors as inputs to inform public health responses for outbreak prevention in
      the context of future climate change. METHODS: Convolutional neural network
      (CNN), Transformer, long short-term memory (LSTM), and attention-enhanced LSTM
      (LSTM-ATT) models were compared with traditional machine learning models on
      weather-based DF forecasting. Models were developed using lagged DF incidence and
      meteorological variables (measures of temperature, humidity, rainfall,
      evaporation, and sunshine hours) as inputs for 20 provinces throughout Vietnam.
      Data from 1997-2013 were used to train models, which were then evaluated using
      data from 2014-2016 by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error
      (MAE). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: LSTM-ATT displayed the highest performance,
      scoring average places of 1.60 for RMSE-based ranking and 1.95 for MAE-based
      ranking. Notably, it was able to forecast DF incidence better than LSTM in 13 or 
      14 out of 20 provinces for MAE or RMSE, respectively. Moreover, LSTM-ATT was able
      to accurately predict DF incidence and outbreak months up to 3 months ahead,
      though performance dropped slightly compared to short-term forecasts. To the best
      of our knowledge, this is the first time deep learning methods have been employed
      for the prediction of both long- and short-term DF incidence and outbreaks in
      Vietnam using unique, rich meteorological features. CONCLUSION: This study
      demonstrates the usefulness of deep learning models for meteorological
      factor-based DF forecasting. LSTM-ATT should be further explored for mitigation
      strategies against DF and other climate-sensitive diseases in the coming years.

TI  - Risk factors for infection with chikungunya and Zika viruses in southern Puerto
      Rico: A community-based cross-sectional seroprevalence survey.
PG  - e0010416
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010416 [doi]
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused a large outbreak in Puerto Rico in 2014,
      followed by a Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in 2016. Communities Organized for the
      Prevention of Arboviruses (COPA) is a cohort study in southern Puerto Rico,
      initiated in 2018 to measure arboviral disease risk and provide a platform to
      evaluate interventions. To identify risk factors for infection, we assessed
      prevalence of previous CHIKV infection and recent ZIKV and DENV infection in a
      cross-sectional study among COPA participants. Participants aged 1-50 years (y)
      were recruited from randomly selected households in study clusters. Each
      participant completed an interview and provided a blood specimen, which was
      tested by anti-CHIKV IgG ELISA assay and anti-ZIKV and anti-DENV IgM MAC-ELISA
      assays. We assessed individual, household, and community factors associated with 
      a positive result for CHIKV or ZIKV after adjusting for confounders. During
      2018-2019, 4,090 participants were enrolled; 61% were female and median age was
      28y (interquartile range [IQR]: 16-41). Among 4,035 participants tested for
      CHIKV, 1,268 (31.4%) had evidence of previous infection. CHIKV infection
      prevalence was lower among children 1-10 years old compared to people 11 and
      older (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.30; 95% CI 1.71-3.08). Lower CHIKV infection
      prevalence was associated with home screens (aOR 0.51; 95% CI 0.42-0.61) and air 
      conditioning (aOR 0.64; 95% CI 0.54-0.77). CHIKV infection prevalence also varied
      by study cluster of residence and insurance type. Few participants (16; 0.4%) had
      evidence of recent DENV infection by IgM. Among 4,035 participants tested for
      ZIKV, 651 (16%) had evidence of recent infection. Infection prevalence increased 
      with older age, from 7% among 1-10y olds up to 19% among 41-50y olds (aOR 3.23;
      95% CI 2.16-4.84). Males had an increased risk of Zika infection prevalence
      compared with females (aOR 1.31; 95% CI 1.09-1.57). ZIKV infection prevalence
      also decreased with the presence of home screens (aOR 0.66; 95% CI 0.54-0.82) and
      air conditioning (aOR 0.69; 95% CI 0.57-0.84). Similar infection patterns were
      observed for recent ZIKV infection prevalence and previous CHIKV infection
      prevalence by age, and the presence of screens and air conditioners in the home
      decreased infection risk from both viruses by as much as 50%.

AB  - Objective: Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Zika virus
      (ZIKV) are several important flaviviruses, and infections caused by these
      flaviviruses remain worldwide health problems. Different flaviviruses exhibit
      different biological characteristics and pathogenicity. Metabolomics is an
      emerging research perspective to uncover and observe the pathogenesis of certain 
      infections. Methods: To improve the understanding of the specific metabolic
      changes that occur during infection with different flaviviruses, considering the 
      principle of noninvasive sampling, this article describes our comprehensive
      analysis of metabolites in urine samples from the three kinds of
      flavivirus-infected mice using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
      method to better understand their infection mechanisms. Results: The urine of
      DENV-, JEV-, and ZIKV-infected mice had 68, 64, and 47 different differential
      metabolites, respectively, compared with the urine of control mice. Among the
      metabolic pathways designed by these metabolites, ABC transporters, arginine and 
      proline metabolism, and regulation of lipolysis play an important role.
      Furthermore, we predicted and fitted potential relationships between metabolites 
      and pathways. Conclusions: These virus-specific altered metabolites may be
      associated with their unique biological properties and pathogenicity. The
      metabolomic analysis of urine is very important for the analysis of flavivirus
      infection.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to detect the presence of IgM antibodies
      against dengue (DEN), chikungunya (CHIK) and Japanese encephalitis (JE) in the
      serum and CSF of patients with Guillaine-Barre syndrome (GBS). Methods: GBS
      patients (>12 years of age) were included after informed consent. Data on
      history, clinical manifestations, treatment details, and outcome were collected. 
      Serum and CSF were tested for IgM antibodies against DEN, CHIK, and JE. Results: 
      From April 2018 to December 2019, 95 patients were included in this study.
      Anti-arboviral IgM antibodies were detected in 30 patients (31.5%) (CSF 11, serum
      13, both CSF and serum 6). Serum IgM antibody was present in 19 patients (JE 8,
      DEN 5, CHIK 2, more than 1 virus 4). Of the 66 patients who underwent CSF
      studies, antibodies were present in 17 (CHIK 14, DEN 1, more than 1 virus 2).
      Antibody positivity did not affect the outcome of GBS. Conclusion: One-third of
      the GBS patients had evidence of recent infection by arboviruses. This suggests
      that DEN, CHIK, and JE could be the inciting event for GBS in endemic regions.

TI  - Dengue Risk Forecast with Mosquito Vector: A Multicomponent Fusion Approach Based
      on Spatiotemporal Analysis.
PG  - 2515432
LID - 10.1155/2022/2515432 [doi]
AB  - Dengue as an acute infectious disease threatens global public health and has
      sparked broad research interest. However, existing studies generally ignore the
      spatial dependencies involved in dengue forecast, and consideration of temporal
      periodicity is absent. In this work, we propose a spatiotemporal component fusion
      model (STCFM) to solve the dengue risk forecast issue. Considering that
      mosquitoes are an important vector of dengue transmission, we introduce feature
      factors involving mosquito abundance and spatiotemporal lags to model temporal
      trends and spatial distributions separately on the basis of statistical
      properties. Specifically, we conduct multiscale modeling of temporal dependencies
      to enhance the forecast capability of relevant periods by capturing the
      historical variation patterns of the data across different segments in the
      temporal dimension. In the spatial dimension, we quantify the multivariate
      spatial correlation analysis as additional features to strengthen the spatial
      feature representation and adopt the ConvLSTM model to learn spatial dependencies
      adequately. The final forecast results are obtained by stacking strategy fusion
      in ensemble learning. We conduct experiments on real dengue datasets. The results
      indicate that STCFM improves prediction accuracy through effective spatiotemporal
      feature representations and outperforms candidate models with a reasonable
      component construction strategy.

AB  - Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection of humans caused by a virus of
      the Flaviviridae family. In Malaysia the annual incidence risk of dengue fever
      for the period 2000 to 2019 ranged from 30 to 390 cases per 100,000. The aim of
      this paper was to identify spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal clusters of
      dengue fever in Peninsular Malaysia for the period 2015 to 2017. Counts of
      confirmed incident cases of dengue fever for each of the 86 districts of
      Peninsular Malaysia for the period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017 (inclusive)
      and district-level census data allowed us to calculate the incidence rate of
      dengue fever, defined as the number of confirmed cases of dengue fever per
      100,000 person-years at risk. We applied Kulldorff's cylindrical space-time scan 
      statistic and Takahashi et al.'s prismatic space-time scan statistic to the data.
      We identified no major differences in the number and location of spatial clusters
      of dengue incidence for 2015, 2016 and 2017 using Kulldorff's and Takahashi et
      al.'s method. Spatio-temporal clusters of dengue occurred at several times
      throughout each year in various high population dense areas. These clusters not
      only included high population density districts but also their adjacent district 
      neighbours. The temporal clustering of dengue cases during the monsoon season
      (mid September to late December each year) implies that there is a biologically
      plausible causal association between rainfall and the incidence of dengue.
      Identification of locations and time periods when the frequency of dengue is high
      allows Malaysian public health authorities to be more objective in their decision
      making around vector control and dengue public awareness campaigns. Future
      research will quantify the association between population density and rainfall on
      dengue incidence. This will allow health authorities to take a more proactive
      approach for dengue control.

AB  - The spatial distribution of surveillance-reported dengue cases and severity are
      usually analyzed separately, assuming independence between the spatial
      distribution of non-severe and severe cases. Given the availability of data for
      the individual geo-location of surveillance-notified dengue cases, we conducted a
      spatial analysis to model non-severe and severe dengue simultaneously, using a
      hierarchical Bayesian model. We fit a joint model to the spatial pattern formed
      by dengue cases as well as to the severity status of the cases. Results showed
      that age and socioeconomic status were associated with dengue presence, and there
      was evidence of clustering for overall cases but not for severity. Our findings
      inform decision making to address the preparedness or implementation of dengue
      control strategies at the local level.

AB  - Vector-borne disease models are widely used to understand the dynamics involved
      in virus transmission. The simplest version of the mechanistic SEIR-SEI model is 
      the most widely used representation of the dynamics involved in vector-borne
      diseases. Modifications to the basic model can improve the complex dynamics'
      acuracy. This work evaluates the capability of different models to represent the 
      dynamics involved in dengue virus transmission. The models include a vector life 
      stage representation, a re-susceptibility factor, and environmental variables in 
      a mechanistic form. Furthermore, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
      methodologies (ARIMA method) were also used for comparison. The inclusion of
      environmental variables and vector life cycle improves the model's accuracy for
      mechanistic models, but the modification's complexity can restrict its
      applicability. Data-driven techniques were shown to be less accurate than all the
      mechanistic-based models (based on all criteria adopted).

AB  - The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a promising technique to control
      mosquitoes, vectors of diseases, like dengue, chikungunya or Zika. However, its
      application in the field is not easy, and its success hinges upon several
      constraints, one of them being that the treated area must be sufficiently
      isolated to limit migration or re-invasion by mosquitoes from the outside. In
      this manuscript we study the impact of males and (fertile) females migration on
      SIT. We show that a critical release rate for sterile males exists for every
      migration level, in the context of continuous or periodic releases. In
      particular, when (fertile) females migration is sufficiently low, then SIT can be
      conducted successfully using either open-loop control or closed-loop control (or 
      a combination of both methods) when regular measurements of the wild population
      are completed. Numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results are
      presented and discussed. Finally, we derive a threshold value for the females
      migration rate, when viruses are circulating, under which it is possible to lower
      the epidemiological risk in the treated area, according to the size of the human 
      population.

TI  - Maternal and foetal-neonatal outcomes of dengue virus infection during pregnancy.
PG  - 619-629
LID - 10.1111/tmi.13783 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Given that women of reproductive age in dengue-endemic areas are at
      risk of infection, it is necessary to determine whether dengue virus (DENV)
      infection during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes. The aim of this
      systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the consequences of DENV
      infection in pregnancy on various maternal and foetal-neonatal outcomes. METHODS:
      A systematic literature search was undertaken using PubMed, Google Scholar, and
      Embase till December 2021. Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios were calculated to report 
      overall effect size using random effect models. The pooled prevalence was
      computed using the random effect model. All statistical analyses were performed
      on MedCalc Software. RESULT: We obtained data from 36 studies involving 39,632
      DENV-infected pregnant women. DENV infection in pregnancy was associated with an 
      increased risk of maternal mortality (OR = 4.14 [95% CI, 1.17-14.73]), stillbirth
      (OR = 2.71 [95% CI, 1.44-5.10]), and neonatal deaths (OR = 3.03 [95% CI,
      1.17-7.83]) compared with pregnant women without DENV infection. There was no
      significant statistical association established between maternal DENV infection
      and the outcomes of preterm birth, maternal bleeding, low birth weight in
      neonates, and risk of miscarriage. Pooled prevalences were 14.9% for dengue shock
      syndrome, 14% for preterm birth, 13.8% for maternal bleeding, 10.1% for low birth
      weight, 6% for miscarriages, and 5.6% for stillbirth. CONCLUSION: DENV infection 
      in pregnant women may be associated with adverse outcomes such as maternal
      mortality, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality. Hence, pregnant women should be
      considered an at-risk population for dengue management programmes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We enhanced surveillance of hospitalizations of all ages for acute
      encephalitis syndrome (AES) along with infectious aetiologies, including the
      Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). METHODS: From October 2018 to September 2020, 
      we screened neurological patients for AES in all age groups in Maharashtra and
      Telangana States. AES cases were enrolled at study hospitals along with other
      referrals and sampled with cerebrospinal fluid, acute and convalescent sera. We
      tested specimens for non-viral aetiologies viz. leptospirosis, typhoid, scrub
      typhus, malaria and acute bacterial meningitis, along with viruses - JEV, Dengue 
      virus (DENV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Chandipura virus (CHPV) and Herpes
      simplex virus (HSV). RESULTS: Among 4977 neurological hospitalizations at three
      study site hospitals over two years period, 857 (17.2%) were AES. However, only
      287 (33.5%) AES cases were eligible. Among 278 (96.9%) enrolled AES cases,
      infectious aetiologies were identified in 115 (41.4%) cases, including non-viral 
      in 17 (6.1%) cases - leptospirosis (8), scrub-typhus (3) and typhoid (6); and
      viral in 98 (35.3%) cases - JEV (58, 20.9%), HSV (22, 7.9%), DENV (15, 5.4%) and 
      CHPV (3, 1.1%). JEV confirmation was significantly higher in enrolled cases than 
      referred cases (10.2%) (p < 0.05). However, the contribution of JEV in AES cases 
      was similar in both children and adults. JE was reported year-round and from
      adjacent non-endemic districts. CONCLUSIONS: The Japanese encephalitis virus
      continues to be the leading cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in central India
      despite vaccination among children. Surveillance needs to be strengthened along
      with advanced diagnostic testing for assessing the impact of vaccination.

LID - jiac173 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac173 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Except for public health case reports, the incidence of Zika virus
      (ZIKV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) infection are not
      available to assess the potential blood transfusion safety threat in Brazil.
      METHODS: Pools of 6 donation samples (MP6) left over from HIV, HBV, and HCV
      nucleic acid testing were combined to create MP18 pools (3 MP6 pools). Samples
      were tested using the Grifols triplex ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV real-time
      transcription mediated amplification assay to estimate prevalence of RNAemia,
      incidence, and to compare these results to case reports in Sao Paulo, Belo
      Horizonte, Recife and Rio de Janeiro, from April 2016 - June 2019. RESULTS: ZIKV,
      CHIKV and DENV RNAemia were found from donors who donated without overt symptoms 
      of infection that would have led to deferral. The highest RNAemic donation
      prevalence was (1.2%, 95% CI 0.8-1.9) for DENV in Belo Horizonte in May 2019.
      Arbovirus infections varied by location, time of year, and were not always
      aligned with annual arbovirus outbreak seasons in different regions of the
      country. CONCLUSIONS: Testing donations for arboviruses in Brazil can contribute 
      to public health. Transfusion recipients were likely exposed to ZIKV, CHIKV, DENV
      viremic blood components during the study period.

TI  - Increased Repellent Effect of DEET on Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) Field
      Population.

AB  - Insecticides and repellents are routinely used in Brazil because of the high
      rates of arbovirus transmission and the nuisance caused by mosquitoes. However,
      few studies have assessed the effectiveness of repellents against mosquito
      populations that have been under exposure to xenobiotics, mainly insecticides and
      repellents. This study investigated the sensitivity of a field population of
      Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) from a dengue-endemic area under high insecticide 
      pressure to N,N-diethylmethylbenzamide (DEET), the active ingredient in common
      repellent products. The field (Laranjeiras, Sergipe, Brazil) and laboratory
      (Rockefeller) populations were characterized for the presence of the Val1016Ile
      kdr mutation, associated with pyrethroid resistance, and locomotor activity.
      Repellency bioassays were performed to assess the response of the mosquitoes to
      human odor by exposing them to 10% DEET applied to the skin in ethanol. Samples
      from the field population showed higher frequency of the kdr mutation, 21.9%
      homozygous and 21.9% heterozygous, greater locomotor activity and greater
      sensitivity to DEET than the laboratory population. These results suggest
      increased sensitivity to DEET in field populations and a possible interaction
      between insecticide exposure and sensitivity to DEET.

AB  - Aims: Dengue is the most common arbovirus in the world. In Africa, dengue virus
      is endemic in almost every country; however, in Togo few data are available. The 
      aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of dengue fever among patients
      with febrile syndrome at the Centre hospitalier universitaire Sylvanus Olympio of
      Lome. Procedure. A cross sectional study was conducted in the Centre hospitalier 
      universitaire Sylvanus Olympio of Lome. Results: One hundred forty-seven patients
      with a median age of 36 years, interquartile range: [23.5-51.5], were included in
      the study. The prevalence of malaria in the sample was 10.2% (95% CI: [5.8-16.3])
      and the prevalence of dengue fever by ELISA was 17% (95% CI: [11.3-24.1]). The
      overall percent agreement between the RDT Dengue NS1 and ELISA for dengue was
      80.9% (95% CI: [73.7-86.9]). The positive percent agreement (PPA) between the RDT
      assay and the ELISA assay considered as the reference was 36%, 95% CI:
      [17.9-57.5]), while the negative percent agreement (NPA) between the two assays
      was 90.2% (95% CI: [83.4-94.8]). Conclusion: This study shows that dengue is as
      much as malaria responsible of febrile syndromes and that it is present in Togo.

AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), the most medically relevant
      tick-transmitted flavivirus in Eurasia, targets the host central nervous system
      and frequently causes severe encephalitis. The severity of TBEV-induced
      neuropathogenesis is highly cell-type specific and the exact mechanism
      responsible for such differences has not been fully described yet. Thus, we
      performed a comprehensive analysis of alterations in host poly-(A)/miRNA/lncRNA
      expression upon TBEV infection in vitro in human primary neurons (high cytopathic
      effect) and astrocytes (low cytopathic effect). Infection with severe but not
      mild TBEV strain resulted in a high neuronal death rate. In comparison, infection
      with either of TBEV strains in human astrocytes did not. Differential expression 
      and splicing analyses with an in silico prediction of miRNA/mRNA/lncRNA/vd-sRNA
      networks found significant changes in inflammatory and immune response pathways, 
      nervous system development and regulation of mitosis in TBEV Hypr-infected
      neurons. Candidate mechanisms responsible for the aforementioned phenomena
      include specific regulation of host mRNA levels via differentially expressed
      miRNAs/lncRNAs or vd-sRNAs mimicking endogenous miRNAs and virus-driven
      modulation of host pre-mRNA splicing. We suggest that these factors are
      responsible for the observed differences in the virulence manifestation of both
      TBEV strains in different cell lines. This work brings the first complex overview
      of alterations in the transcriptome of human astrocytes and neurons during the
      infection by two TBEV strains of different virulence. The resulting data could
      serve as a starting point for further studies dealing with the mechanism of
      TBEV-host interactions and the related processes of TBEV pathogenesis.

AB  - Over the last decades, an increase in the emergence or re-emergence of
      arthropod-borne viruses has been observed in many regions. Viruses such as
      dengue, yellow fever, or zika are a threat for millions of people on different
      continents. On the other hand, some arboviruses are still described as endemic,
      however, they could become more important in the near future. Additionally, there
      is a group of arboviruses that, although important for animal breeding, are not a
      direct threat for human health. Those include, e.g., Schmallenberg, bluetongue,
      or African swine fever viruses. This review focuses on arboviruses and their
      major vectors: mosquitoes, ticks, biting midges, and sandflies. We discuss the
      current knowledge on arbovirus transmission, ecology, and methods of prevention. 
      As arboviruses are a challenge to both human and animal health, successful
      prevention and control are therefore only possible through a One Health
      perspective.

TI  - Treatment-Seeking Behaviors and Knowledge, Attitude and Practices among Suspected
      Dengue Adult Patients at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand.
LID - 6657 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19116657 [doi]
AB  - Dengue infection is a major public health problem in Thailand with an increasing 
      incidence in the adult population. Patients' knowledge, attitude and practices
      (KAP) with regarding dengue infection have direct influences on treatment-seeking
      behaviors and clinical outcomes. We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess
      the KAP and treatment-seeking behaviors of suspected dengue adult patients
      attending the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD) in Bangkok, from March 2014 to
      February 2015. Among 167 participants, the majority of participants (87.9%) were 
      unaware of dengue infection and most of them reported initial self-medication
      (95.2%). The mean days of fever before attending to the HTD was 4.9 +/- 1.7 days.
      Outpatient cases reported seeking care significantly earlier than inpatient cases
      (mean: 3.1 days vs. 5.0 days; p &lt; 0.001). The majority of patients believed
      that dengue infection has a high mortality rate (63%) and must be treated in
      hospital (91.3%), highlighting the lack of understanding and misperceptions
      regarding dengue-related knowledge in the general population. Patients who
      reported recent or current dengue infection in their family or neighborhood
      sought medical care early and reported good preventive practices. Health
      education should focus on the adult population to improve awareness of dengue
      symptoms and promote early treatment-seeking behavior.

TI  - The Effects of Meteorological Factors on Dengue Cases in Malaysia.
LID - 6449 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19116449 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a vector-borne disease affected by meteorological factors and is
      commonly recorded from ground stations. Data from ground station have limited
      spatial representation and accuracy, which can be overcome using satellite-based 
      Earth Observation (EO) recordings instead. EO-based meteorological recordings can
      help to provide a better understanding of the correlations between meteorological
      variables and dengue cases. This paper aimed to first validate the
      satellite-based (EO) data of temperature, wind speed, and rainfall using ground
      station data. Subsequently, we aimed to determine if the spatially matched EO
      data correlated with dengue fever cases from 2011 to 2019 in Malaysia. EO data
      were spatially matched with the data from four ground stations located at states 
      and districts in the central (Selangor, Petaling) and east coast (Kelantan, Kota 
      Baharu) geographical regions of Peninsular Malaysia. Spearman's rank-order
      correlation coefficient (rho) was performed to examine the correlation between EO
      and ground station data. A cross-correlation analysis with an eight-week lag
      period was performed to examine the magnitude of correlation between EO data and 
      dengue case across the three time periods (2011-2019, 2015-2019, 2011-2014). The 
      highest correlation between the ground-based stations and corresponding EO data
      were reported for temperature (mean rho = 0.779), followed by rainfall (mean rho 
      = 0.687) and wind speed (mean rho = 0.639). Overall, positive correlations were
      observed between weekly dengue cases and rainfall for Selangor and Petaling
      across all time periods with significant correlations being observed for the
      period from 2011 to 2019 and 2015 to 2019. In addition, positive significant
      correlations were also observed between weekly dengue cases and temperature for
      Kelantan and Kota Baharu across all time periods, while negative significant
      correlations between weekly dengue cases and temperature were observed in
      Selangor and Petaling across all time periods. Overall negative correlations were
      observed between weekly dengue cases and wind speed in all areas from 2011 to
      2019 and 2015 to 2019, with significant correlations being observed for the
      period from 2015 to 2019. EO-derived meteorological variables explained 48.2% of 
      the variation in dengue cases in Selangor. Moderate to strong correlations were
      observed between meteorological variables recorded from EO data derived from
      satellites and ground stations, thereby justifying the use of EO data as a viable
      alternative to ground stations for recording meteorological variables. Both
      rainfall and temperature were found to be positively correlated with weekly
      dengue cases; however, wind speed was negatively correlated with dengue cases.

AB  - The mosquito's innate immune system defends against a variety of pathogens, and
      the conserved siRNA pathway plays a central role in the control of viral
      infections. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of Dicer2 (Dcr2) or R2d2
      resulted in an accumulation of 21-nucleotide viral sequences that was accompanied
      by a significant suppression of dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and
      chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication, thus indicating the broad-spectrum
      antiviral response mediated by the siRNA pathway that can be applied for the
      development of novel arbovirus control strategies. Interestingly, overexpression 
      of Dcr2 or R2d2 regulated the mRNA abundance of a variety of antimicrobial immune
      genes, pointing to additional functions of DCR2 and R2D2 as well as cross-talk
      between the siRNA pathway and other immune pathways. Accordingly, transgenic
      overexpression of Dcr2 or R2d2 resulted in a lesser proliferation of the midgut
      microbiota and increased resistance to bacterial and fungal infections.

PG  - e1010552
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010552 [doi]
AB  - Arboviruses are etiological agents of various severe human diseases that place a 
      tremendous burden on global public health and the economy; compounding this issue
      is the fact that effective prophylactics and therapeutics are lacking for most
      arboviruses. Herein, we identified 2 bacterial lipases secreted by a
      Chromobacterium bacterium isolated from Aedes aegypti midgut, Chromobacterium
      antiviral effector-1 (CbAE-1) and CbAE-2, with broad-spectrum virucidal activity 
      against mosquito-borne viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV),
      Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and Sindbis virus
      (SINV). The CbAEs potently blocked viral infection in the extracellular milieu
      through their lipase activity. Mechanistic studies showed that this lipase
      activity directly disrupted the viral envelope structure, thus inactivating
      infectivity. A mutation in the lipase motif of CbAE-1 fully abrogated the
      virucidal ability. Furthermore, CbAEs also exert lipase-dependent
      entomopathogenic activity in mosquitoes. The anti-arboviral and entomopathogenic 
      properties of CbAEs render them potential candidates for the development of novel
      transmission control strategies against vector-borne diseases.

      review.
LID - 10.1007/s13365-022-01082-3 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever has been associated with several neurological complications,
      cerebellar involvement being among the rarest of them. Here, we describe the case
      of a 70-year-old female who presented a cerebellar syndrome during the first day 
      of an arboviral infection, posteriorly confirmed as dengue fever. Among the seven
      other cases in which the relationship between dengue virus and ataxia was
      reported, only in one cerebellar presentation occurred as early. Onset, course,
      and prognosis, as well as the adequate investigation and management of these
      patients, are discussed. While the disease pattern is not better characterized by
      future studies, differential diagnosis and close follow-up are essential tools
      for guaranteeing good outcomes.

TI  - Subtilisin of Leishmania amazonensis as Potential Druggable Target: Subcellular
      Localization, In Vitro Leishmanicidal Activity and Molecular Docking of
      PF-429242, a Subtilisin Inhibitor.
PG  - 2089-2106
LID - 10.3390/cimb44050141 [doi]
AB  - Subtilisin proteases, found in all organisms, are enzymes important in the
      post-translational steps of protein processing. In Leishmania major and L.
      donovani, this enzyme has been described as essential to their survival; however,
      few compounds that target subtilisin have been investigated for their potential
      as an antileishmanial drug. In this study, we first show, by electron microscopy 
      and flow cytometry, that subtilisin has broad localization throughout the
      cytoplasm and membrane of the parasite in the promastigote form with foci in the 
      flagellar pocket. Through in silico analysis, the similarity between subtilisin
      of different Leishmania species and that of humans were determined, and based on 
      molecular docking, we evaluated the interaction capacity of a serine protease
      inhibitor against both life cycle forms of Leishmania. The selected inhibitor,
      known as PF-429242, has already been used against the dengue virus, arenaviruses,
      and the hepatitis C virus. Moreover, it proved to have antilipogenic activity in 
      a mouse model and caused hypolipidemia in human cells in vitro. Here, PF-429242
      significantly inhibited the growth of L. amazonensis promastigotes of four
      different strains (IC50 values = 3.07 +/- 0.20; 0.83 +/- 0.12; 2.02 +/- 0.27 and 
      5.83 +/- 1.2 microM against LTB0016, PH8, Josefa and LV78 strains) whilst having 
      low toxicity in the host macrophages (CC50 = 170.30 microM). We detected by flow 
      cytometry that there is a greater expression of subtilisin in the amastigote
      form; however, PF-429242 had a low effect against this intracellular form with an
      IC50 of &gt;100 microM for intracellular amastigotes, as well as against axenic
      amastigotes (94.12 +/- 2.8 microM for the LV78 strain). In conclusion, even
      though PF-429242 does not affect the intracellular forms, this drug will serve as
      a tool to explore pharmacological and potentially leishmanicidal targets.

TI  - Historical overview and update on relapsing fever group Borrelia in Latin
      America.
PG  - 196
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05289-5 [doi]
AB  - Relapsing fever group Borrelia (RFGB) are motile spirochetes transmitted to
      mammalian or avian hosts through the bite of hematophagous arthropods, such as
      soft ticks (Argasidae), hard ticks (Ixodidae) and the human clothing lice. RFGB
      can infect pets such as dogs and cats, as well as birds, cattle and humans.
      Borrelia recurrentis, B. anserina and B. theileri are considered to have
      worldwide distribution, affecting humans, domestic birds and ruminants,
      respectively. Borrelia spp. associated with soft ticks are transmitted mainly by 
      Ornithodoros ticks and thrive in endemic foci in tropical and subtropical
      latitudes. Nowadays, human cases of soft tick-borne relapsing fever remain
      neglected diseases in several countries, and the impact these spirochetes have on
      the health of wild and domestic animals is largely understudied. Human infection 
      with RFGB is difficult to diagnose, given the lack of distinguishing clinical
      features (undifferentiated febrile illness). Clinically, soft tick or louse-borne
      relapsing fever is often confused with other etiologies, such as malaria, typhoid
      or dengue. In Latin America, during the first half of the twentieth century
      historical documents elaborated by enlightened physicians were seminal, and
      resulted in the identification of RFGB and their associated vectors in countries 
      such as Mexico, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Argentina. Almost 80 years 
      later, research on relapsing fever spirochetes is emerging once again in Latin
      America, with molecular characterizations and isolations of novel RFGB members in
      Panama, Bolivia, Brazil and Chile. In this review we summarize historical aspects
      of RFGB in Latin America and provide an update on the current scenario regarding 
      these pathogens in the region. To accomplish this, we conducted an exhaustive
      search of all the published literature for the region, including old medical
      theses deposited in libraries of medical academies. RFGB were once common
      pathogens in Latin America, and although unnoticed for many years, they are
      currently the focus of interest among the scientific community. A One Health
      perspective should be adopted to tackle the diseases caused by RFGB, since these 
      spirochetes have never disappeared and the maladies they cause may be confused
      with etiologies with similar symptoms that prevail in the region.

AB  - The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses of
      humans. Several live-attenuated tetravalent DENV vaccines are at different stages
      of clinical development and approval. In children with no baseline immunity to
      DENVs, a leading vaccine (Dengvaxia) is efficacious against vaccine-matched DENV4
      genotype II (GII) strains but not vaccine-mismatched DENV4 GI viruses. We use a
      panel of recombinant DENV4 viruses displaying GI or GII envelope (E) proteins to 
      map Dengvaxia-induced neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) linked to protection. The
      vaccine stimulated antibodies that neutralize the DENV4 GII virus better than the
      GI virus. The neutralization differences map to 5 variable amino acids on the E
      protein located within a region targeted by DENV4 NAbs, supporting a mechanistic 
      role for these epitope-specific NAbs in protection. In children with no baseline 
      immunity to DENVs, levels of DENV4 serotype- and genotype-specific NAbs induced
      by vaccination are predictive of vaccine efficacy.

AB  - This article analyzes how dengue presented a virological challenge during the
      1980s in order to explore the role of virological studies in understanding this
      disease and constructing expertise in arboviral diseases. Although outbreaks were
      reported throughout the twentieth century, dengue was barely known in the
      Americas until the epidemic of dengue fever in Cuba in 1981. When the disease
      reached the Brazilian city of Nova Iguacu (RJ) in 1986, it became the focus of
      attention for a team of virologists led by Hermann Schatzmayr, who mobilized
      efforts after the creation of the Flavivirus Laboratory at the Oswaldo Cruz
      Institute.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This research addresses two questions: (1) how El Nino Southern
      Oscillation (ENSO) affects climate variability and how it influences dengue
      transmission in the Metropolitan Region of Recife (MRR), and (2) whether the
      epidemic in MRR municipalities has any connection and synchronicity. METHODS:
      Wavelet analysis and cross-correlation were applied to characterize seasonality, 
      multiyear cycles, and relative delays between the series. This study was
      developed into two distinct periods. Initially, we performed periodic dengue
      incidence and intercity epidemic synchronism analyses from 2001 to 2017. We then 
      defined the period from 2001 to 2016 to analyze the periodicity of climatic
      variables and their coherence with dengue incidence. RESULTS: Our results showed 
      systematic cycles of 3-4 years with a recent shortening trend of 2-3 years.
      Climatic variability, such as positive anomalous temperatures and reduced
      rainfall due to changes in sea surface temperature (SST), is partially linked to 
      the changing epidemiology of the disease, as this condition provides suitable
      environments for the Aedes aegypti lifecycle. CONCLUSION: ENSO may have
      influenced the dengue temporal patterns in the MRR, transiently reducing its main
      way of multiyear variability (3-4 years) to 2-3 years. Furthermore, when the
      epidemic coincided with El Nino years, it spread regionally and was highly
      synchronized.

AB  - Dengue is a main public health issue around the world and is an epidemic in
      Brazil. As part of the Brazilian national program to fight the disease, every
      municipality has a Zoonosis Control Center responsible for health and case
      surveillance, among other actions. The fieldwork includes routine visiting of
      houses and strategic sites (e.g. industries and vacant lands), water sampling,
      container elimination, and larvicide administration. However, the field data are 
      gathered and summarized by hand. In this work, our goal is to ease the collection
      and visualization of field data to support decision-making. We have developed a
      mobile system to collect and georeference field data which could then be used to 
      build geospatial and geo-temporal visualizations of indices such as House,
      Container, and Breteau1 indices. This solution could enhance entomological
      surveillance and leverage action planning and evaluation.

      case report and literature review.
PG  - 40
LID - 10.1186/s12969-022-00699-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) is a subgroup of
      idiopathic inflammatory myopathies manifesting with progressive weakness,
      elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, and necrotizing myopathic features on
      muscle biopsy. There is a paucity of data on the clinical presentation of IMNM in
      children. We report a paediatric patient who developed
      anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (anti-HMGCR)-positive necrotizing
      myopathy after recent dengue infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy
      9-year-old boy presented with acute proximal muscle weakness after recovery from 
      dengue infection. Five days after the fever subsided, he could not stand from a
      squatting position. He denied having skin rash, arthritis, or other systemic
      features. He had marked elevation of CK level of 30,833 mg/dL and was put on
      steroid therapy. The patient initially responded to oral prednisolone, however
      the weakness persisted and muscle enzymes increased as steroids were decreased.
      He was then referred to our hospital for further assessment. Subsequent
      investigation revealed anti-HMGCR positivity along with specific
      histopathological findings consistent with IMNM. The patient was treated with six
      cycles of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) monthly, then followed by a gradual
      taper of prednisolone and oral methotrexate weekly with complete recovery in
      motor power. CONCLUSIONS: Our report presents a child with clinical
      manifestations of IMNM which can be categorized as acute onset of muscle weakness
      following dengue infection. Two key points supporting a diagnosis in this case
      are clinical response after immunosuppressive therapy and absence of rashes found
      in juvenile dermatomyositis.

AB  - Arboviral infections are an important differential diagnosis in returning
      travelers with fever, muscle or joint pain and rash. Arboviruses have spread
      widely around the globe in the last decades. The most common arboviral infections
      in returning travelers from tropical and subtropical areas are dengue,
      chikungunya and zika. Their most important vectors, Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquito
      species, have adapted to the urban environment, which enabled arboviruses to
      establish urban transmission cycles. Population growth, urbanization,
      globalization, modern means of transportation and global warming are speeding up 
      their spread.Laboratory confirmation of an arboviral infection can generally be
      obtained by direct virus detection (PCR, antigen test) in the first week of
      illness; from the second week of illness serology can be used. Treatment is
      mostly symptomatic.Dengue fever is the most common cause of fever in returning
      travelers from South-East Asia. Patients have to be educated about and observed
      for warning signs of severe dengue that can rarely develop around day 5 of the
      disease and is marked by a rise in hematocrit.Chikungunya mostly occurs in
      epidemics and is characterized by severe and often long-lasting
      arthritis.Preconceptional screening for zika virus infection is not recommended. 
      Instead, travelers should delay conception for up to three months after returning
      from a zika endemic area.Dengue, chikungunya and zika vaccine development has
      been hampered by difficulties, for example antibody-dependent-enhancement or the 
      unpredictability of outbreaks, and up to now no vaccines for travelers have been 
      licensed. Yet several promising vaccine candidates are currently under
      development.

AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis produces several virulence factors, the main ones being
      the Cry and Cyt toxins, present in the parasporal body produced during
      sporulation. The Cyt toxins have mechanisms specific for mosquitoes and Cyt1Aa,
      the most studied cytolytic toxin, is effective for mosquito control by acting in 
      synergism with Cry toxins. The goal of the present work was to study the
      frequency of the codifying gene for Cyt1Aa in B. thuringiensis native isolates
      acquired from samples of soil, insect and water, as well as to verify any
      possible genetic polymorphism. 1,448 B thuringiensis strains were used for DNA
      extraction and PCR technique, all with the use of a primer that amplifies a
      fragment of 300 pairs of the cyt1Aa gene. The strains that showed amplification
      in the PCR reaction were sequenced and compared to each other and to the
      sequences available at Genbank. 32 (2.3%) strains of B. thuringiensis showed
      positive amplification for the cyt1Aa gene. The highest frequency of isolates
      with cyt1Aa gene was acquired from samples coming from the Cerrado biome, both
      isolates from soil and from insects, equally with 3.4%. The cyt1Aa gene
      sequencing highlighted that, for that 300 bp region, the gene is conserved and
      there is no single-base polymorphism.

TI  - A High-Throughput Yellow Fever Neutralization Assay.
PG  - e0254821
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02548-21 [doi]
AB  - Quick and accurate detection of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against yellow
      fever is essential in serodiagnosis during outbreaks for surveillance and to
      evaluate vaccine efficacy in population-wide studies. All of this requires
      serological assays that can process a large number of samples in a highly
      standardized format. Albeit being laborious, time-consuming, and limited in
      throughput, the classical plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is still
      considered the gold standard for the detection and quantification of nAbs due to 
      its sensitivity and specificity. Here, we report the development of an
      alternative fluorescence-based serological assay (SNT(FLUO)) with an equally high
      sensitivity and specificity that is fit for high-throughput testing with the
      potential for automation. Finally, our novel SNT(FLUO) was cross-validated in
      several reference laboratories and against international WHO standards, showing
      its potential to be implemented in clinical use. SNT(FLUO) assays with similar
      performance are available for the Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and dengue viruses
      amenable to differential diagnostics. IMPORTANCE Fast and accurate detection of
      neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against yellow fever virus (YFV) is key in yellow 
      fever serodiagnosis, outbreak surveillance, and monitoring of vaccine efficacy.
      Although classical PRNT remains the gold standard for measuring YFV nAbs, this
      methodology suffers from inherent limitations such as low throughput and overall 
      high labor intensity. We present a novel fluorescence-based serum neutralization 
      test (SNT(FLUO)) with equally high sensitivity and specificity that is fit for
      processing a large number of samples in a highly standardized manner and has the 
      potential to be implemented for clinical use. In addition, we present SNT(FLUO)
      assays with similar performance for Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and dengue
      viruses, opening new avenues for differential diagnostics.

LID - 10.2147/IDR.S360675 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: In recent decades, the rate of infection with dengue virus (DENV)
      has risen significantly, now affecting nearly 400 million individuals annually.
      Dengue fever among humans is caused via specific mosquito vectors bites. Sporadic
      cases have been reported in Egypt. The goal of this study was to identify the
      serotype of the DENV outbreak in both human and mosquito vector along the coast
      of the Red Sea, Upper Egypt, in 2017. Identification of the serotype of the virus
      may help identify its source and assist in applying epidemiological and control
      measures. Materials and Methods: The current study was carried out in El Quseir
      City, Red Sea Governorate, Upper Egypt, on 144 patients complaining of symptoms
      indicative of dengue fever at the time of the 2017 Egypt outbreak. Human blood
      samples and the mosquito reservoirs were identified as having dengue virus
      infection serologically and molecularly. Results: Overall, 97 (67.4%) patients
      were positive for dengue virus IgM antibodies. Molecular examination of the human
      samples and pools of mosquitoes revealed that DENV-2 virus was the serotype
      responsible for the outbreak. Only one pool of female mosquitoes containing Aedes
      aegypti was infected with dengue fever virus (DENV-2). Conclusion: This was the
      first serotyping of the DENV responsible for dengue virus outbreak in Egypt in
      2017. Determining the serotype of dengue virus can help to avoid and monitor
      outbreaks. The serotype identified in this study was DENV-2, while DENV-1 was the
      serotype found in the previous outbreak in 2015 in the province of Assiut. This
      study thus raises concerns that a new dengue serotype could have been introduced 
      into Egypt. It is necessary for a comprehensive risk assessment to be carried out
      in the country, including an entomological survey, to assess the presence and
      potential geographical expansion of mosquito vectors there.

TI  - Establishment of Wolbachia infection in Aedes aegypti from Pakistan via embryonic

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is mainly spread by
      Aedes aegypti. It is prevalent on five continents, predominantly in tropical and 
      sub-tropical zones across the world. Wolbachia bacteria have been extensively
      used in vector control strategies worldwide. The focus of the current study was
      to obtain a natural population of Ae. aegypti harbouring Wolbachia and to
      determine the impact of this bacteria on the new host in a semi-field
      environment. METHODS: Wolbachia-infected Aedes albopictus was collected from the 
      city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, and Wolbachia were successfully introduced into
      laboratory-reared Ae. aegypti via embryonic microinjection. The stable vertical
      transmission of wAlbB in the host population was observed for eight generations, 
      and the impact of Wolbachia on the general fitness of the host was evaluated in
      semi-field conditions. RESULTS: In the laboratory and semi-field experiments,
      wAlbB Wolbachia presented a strong cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) effect,
      evidenced as zero egg hatching, in crosses between Wolbachia-infected males and
      wild (uninfected) females of Ae. aegypti. Wolbachia infection had no noticeable
      impact on the general fitness (P > 0.05), fecundity, body size (females and
      males) and mating competitiveness of the new host, Ae. aegypti. However, there
      was a significant decrease in female fertility (egg hatch) (P < 0.001). In
      addition, under starvation conditions, there was a remarkable decrease (P <
      0.0001) in the life span of Wolbachia-infected females compared to uninfected
      females (4 vs. > 5 days, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Wolbachia strain wAlbB has a
      great potential to control the dengue vector in Ae. aegypti populations by
      producing 100% CI with a limited burden on its host in natural field conditions. 
      This strain can be used as a biological tool against vector-borne diseases.

TI  - A prospective observational study to compare transfusion outcomes in ABO
      identical versus ABO non-identical single donor platelet concentrates: An
      experience from a tertiary healthcare center in India.

AB  - ABO incompatible single donor platelet concentrates (SDPC) have a concern about
      unsatisfactory increments as well as possibility of hemolytic transfusion
      reaction. But from Indian population no study has commented on the clinical and
      laboratory outcome of ABO mismatched platelet transfusion. The aim of study was
      to compare transfusion outcomes in ABO identical versus ABO non-identical single 
      donor platelet concentrates. In this prospective observational study, 400 SDPC
      transfusions among different patients were included. In group A (n=200), ABO
      identical SDPC transfusions and in group B (n=200) ABO non-identical SDPC
      transfusions were added. Corrective count increment (CCI), absolute count
      increment (ACI), percent platelet recovery (PPR) were calculated and incidents of
      hemolytic transfusion reactions were noted. In group A mean+/-SD of ACI, CCI and 
      PPR were as 30.78+/-12.51, 15.10+/-6.677, 39,948.9+/-20,099.392. In group B,
      mean+/-SD of ACI, CCI and PPR were - 25.4+/-15.65, 12.509+/-5.906,
      33,559.2+/-22,150.304. And when CCI, ACI, PPR were compared with group A and
      group B, statistically significant differences were noted (P<0.05). There was
      statistically significant difference in CCI, ACI and PPR in oncology patients and
      other prophylactic recipients except patients with dengue and other infectious
      disease. But there was no hemolytic transfusion reaction noted in any group. Our 
      study clearly establish the potential benefits of ABO-identical PLT transfusion. 
      It also points out that in emergency conditions or when there is a paucity in
      inventory, ABO non-identical SDPC transfusion may be lifesaving and clinically
      significant.

AB  - Platelet activation is commonly detected after infection by multiple viruses such
      as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), H1N1 influenza, Hepatitis C virus (HCV),
      Ebola virus (EBV), and Dengue virus (DENV). Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute
      the majority of the human transcribed genome, but the biology of platelet ncRNAs 
      is largely unexplored. In this study, we performed microarray profiling to
      characterize the expression profile of human platelets infected with EBV in vitro
      after 2 h. A total of 187 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) displayed differences,
      of which 114 were upregulated and 73 were downregulated; 78 microRNAs (miRNAs)
      showed differences, including 73 upregulated and 5 downregulated; 808 mRNAs
      displayed differences, among which 367 were upregulated and 441 were
      downregulated. Gene ontology (GO) analysis mostly related to G protein-coupled
      receptor signaling pathway, detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory
      perception of smell and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Pathway
      analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in
      cell metabolism and immune-related response. A ceRNA network was established
      based on predicting regulatory pairs in differentially expressed genes, in which 
      hsa-miR-6877-3p had the highest regulatory capability (degree = 31), FAM230A was 
      the lncRNA with the highest regulatory capability (degree = 28). According to the
      EBV related miRNA regulation network, it revealed that ebv-miR-BART19-3p had the 
      most target genes and BRWD1, FAM126B, TFRC and JMY were the genes most regulated 
      by EBV-related miRNAs. After overlapping the three networks, we found that the
      EIFAK2 gene was strongly correlated with autologous ncRNAs, including
      hsa-miR-1972, hsa-miR-504-3p and hsa-miR-6825-5p, as well as with EBV ncRNAs,
      including EBER1, EBER2, miR-BART7-3p and miR-BART16. The present study
      contributes to a better understanding of the expression profiling of ncRNAs and
      their functions in platelets activated by EBV in vitro, and paves the way to
      further study on platelet function.

AB  - Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses uses
      artificial containers around homes to undergo immature development, making
      household-level detection and control extremely difficult in large urban areas.
      Mass trapping is an emerging methodology to control container-Aedes species such 
      as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus because effective traps for adult stages of
      these mosquitoes were developed recently. There are three main approaches to
      mass-trapping these mosquitoes: 1) Pull (attract/kill), 2) push (repel)-pull
      (attract/kill), and 3) pull (attract/contaminate/infect)-push (fly away).
      Effective mass-trapping depends on trap quality (capture efficiency, sturdiness, 
      frequency of servicing), trap density and areal coverage, community involvement, 
      and safety. Recent studies showed that Ae. aegypti populations can be sustainably
      controlled by mass trapping, although more area-wide studies showing
      effectiveness at preventing disease are needed for all trapping systems.
      Cost-effectiveness studies are needed for all emerging Aedes control approaches.

TI  - A Bayesian Prediction Spatial Model for Confirmed Dengue Cases in the State of
      Chiapas, Mexico.

AB  - Dengue is one of the major health problems in the state of Chiapas. Consequently,
      spatial information on the distribution of the disease can optimize directed
      control strategies. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a simple 
      Bayesian prediction spatial model for the state of Chiapas, Mexico. This is an
      ecological study that uses data from a range of sources. Dengue cases occurred
      from January to August 2019. The data analysis used the spatial correlation of
      dengue cases (DCs), which was calculated with the Moran index statistic, and a
      generalized linear spatial model (GLSM) within a Bayesian framework, which was
      considered to model the spatial distribution of DCs in the state of Chiapas. We
      selected the climatological, geographic, and sociodemographic variables related
      to the study area. A prediction of the model on Chiapas maps was carried out
      based on the places where the cases were registered. We find a spatial
      correlation of 0.115 (p value=0.001)between neighboring municipalities using the 
      Moran index. The variables that have an effect on the number of confirmed cases
      of dengue are the maximum temperature (Coef=0.110; 95% CrI: 0.076 - 0.215),
      rainfall (Coef=0.013; 95% CrI:0.008 - 0.028), and altitude (Coef=0.00045; 95%
      CrI:0.00002 - 0.00174) of each municipality. The predicting power is notably
      better in regions that have a greater number of municipalities where DCs are
      registered. The model shows the importance of considering these variables to
      prevent future DCs in vulnerable areas.

AB  - Background and Objectives: In recent decades, the incidence of dengue has
      increased dramatically. In dengue-endemic countries, changes in dengue virus
      serotypes, genotypes, and lineages have been reported. This study was designed to
      detect and characterize the dengue virus isolates circulating in North India by
      serological and molecular techniques. Materials and Methods: This study was
      conducted at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research
      (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India. NS1 antigen and IgM antibody against dengue were
      detected by ELISA methods, viral RNA was extracted and amplified by conventional 
      PCR and one-step single-tube multiplex PCR. The purified PCR products were cycle 
      sequenced and a database search was implemented for the confirmation of the
      sequence product. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out with previously reported 
      sequences. Results: Among 1509 samples, 205 (13.6%) were found positive for IgM
      antibodies with the highest number (n=67) among the 21 to 30 years age group with
      peak positivity during post-monsoon months. Among acute samples, NS1 antigen was 
      positive in 62.9%. Seven patients out of 13 had dengue viral RNA in PCR. It
      comprised six DENV-2 serotypes and one DENV-3 serotype. On phylogenetic analysis,
      DENV-2 strains grouped with genotype IV and DENV-3 with genotype III. Conclusion:
      Dengue infection was found frequently during post-monsoon season. The positivity 
      rate of the dengue NS1 antigen test was greater than that of the antibody test.
      The dengue isolates were characterized as genotype IV and genotype III of DENV-2 
      and DENV-3 respectively.

TI  - Bomidin: An Optimized Antimicrobial Peptide With Broad Antiviral Activity Against
      Enveloped Viruses.
PG  - 851642
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.851642 [doi]
AB  - The rapid evolution of highly infectious pathogens is a major threat to global
      public health. In the front line of defense against bacteria, fungi, and viruses,
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally produced by all living organisms and 
      offer new possibilities for next-generation antibiotic development. However, the 
      low yields and difficulties in the extraction and purification of AMPs have
      hindered their industry and scientific research applications. To overcome these
      barriers, we enabled high expression of bomidin, a commercial recombinant AMP
      based upon bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide-27. This novel AMP, which can be 
      expressed in Escherichia coli by adding methionine to the bomidin sequence, can
      be produced in bulk and is more biologically active than chemically synthesized
      AMPs. We verified the function of bomidin against a variety of bacteria and
      enveloped viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
      (SARS-CoV-2), herpes simplex virus (HSV), dengue virus (DENV), and chikungunya
      virus (CHIKV). Furthermore, based on the molecular modeling of bomidin and
      membrane lipids, we elucidated the possible mechanism by which bomidin disrupts
      bacterial and viral membranes. Thus, we obtained a novel AMP with an optimized,
      efficient heterologous expression system for potential therapeutic application
      against a wide range of life-threatening pathogens.

TI  - Study of Utility of Basic Arterial Blood Gas Parameters and Lactate as Prognostic
      Markers in Patients With Severe Dengue.
PG  - e24682
LID - 10.7759/cureus.24682 [doi]
AB  - Background The importance of prognostication in critical care cannot be
      over-emphasized, especially in the context of diseases like dengue, as their
      presentation may vary from mild fever to critical life-threatening illness. With 
      the help of prognostic markers, it is possible to identify patients at higher
      risk and thus improve their outcome with timely intervention. Basic arterial
      blood gas (ABG) parameters, i.e., potential of hydrogen (pH), partial pressure of
      oxygen (PO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) and bicarbonate are
      useful parameters, especially in critical care medicine as they are known to vary
      with the severity of illness. Hyperlactatemia is often referred to as a "powerful
      predictor of mortality". Basic ABG parameters and lactate have been used as an
      essential prognostic modality in critically ill patients for decades; however,
      the evidence remains limited for their role as prognostic markers in patients
      with severe dengue. Method We carried out an observational retrospective cohort
      study comprising 163 patients with severe dengue, admitted between July 2021 and 
      November 2021 at Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) of Shri Ram Murti Smarak
      Institute of Medical Sciences (SRMS IMS), Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India. Basic
      ABG parameters and lactate levels at the time of admission to MICU were compared 
      between survivor and non-survivor groups of patients with severe dengue in order 
      to evaluate their prognostic utility as predictors of mortality. Results pH
      (p<0.0001), PO2 (p=0.01) and bicarbonate (<0.0001) levels were significantly
      lower, while PCO2 (p=0.002) and lactate (p<0.0001) levels were significantly
      higher in non-survivor group as compared to survivor group. Lactate was found to 
      be the best prognostic marker with Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 88.7% on
      Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. Conclusion Basic arterial
      blood gas parameters and lactate can be used as feasible prognostic markers in
      patients with severe dengue.

TI  - Molecular Characterization and Phylogenetic Analysis of the 2019 Dengue Outbreak 
      in Wenzhou, China.
PG  - 829380
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.829380 [doi]
AB  - In 2019, a dengue outbreak occurred with 290 confirmed cases in Wenzhou, a
      coastal city in southeast China. To identify the origin of the dengue virus
      (DENV) from this outbreak, viral RNA was extracted from four serum samples and
      sequenced for whole genome analysis. Then, phylogenetic analysis, gene mutation, 
      secondary structure prediction, selection pressure analysis, and recombination
      analysis were performed. DENV strains Cam-03 and Cam-11 were isolated from
      patients traveling from Cambodia, while ZJWZ-18 and ZJWZ-62 strains were isolated
      from local patients without a record of traveling abroad. The whole genome
      sequence of all four strains was 10,735 nucleotides long. Phylogenetic tree
      analysis showed that the four strains belonged to genotype 1 of DENV-1, but the
      local Wenzhou strains and imported strains clustered in different branches.
      ZJWZ-18 and ZJWZ-62 were closely related to strain MF033254-Singapore-2016, and
      Cam-03 and Cam-11 were closely related to strain AB608788-China : Taiwan-1994. A 
      comparison of the coding regions between the local strains and the DENV-1
      standard strain (EU848545-Hawaii-1944) showed 82 amino acid mutations between the
      two strains. A total of 55 amino acid mutations were found between the coding
      regions of the local and imported strains. The overall secondary structure of the
      3' UTR of the local strains had changed: apparent changes in the head and tail
      position were observed when compared to DENV-1 standard strain. Furthermore,
      selection pressure analysis and recombination detection using the 4 isolates and 
      41 reference strains showed two credible positive selection sites and eight
      credible recombination events, which warrant further studies. This study may
      enhance the understanding of viral replication, infection, evolution, virulence, 
      and pathogenicity of DENV.

      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

AB  - Non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) implemented during the coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have demonstrated significant positive effects
      on other communicable diseases. Nevertheless, the response for dengue fever has
      been mixed. To illustrate the real implications of NPIs on dengue transmission
      and to determine the effective measures for preventing and controlling dengue, we
      performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available global data to
      summarize the effects comprehensively. We searched Embase, PubMed, and Web of
      Science in line with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
      Meta-Analyses) guidelines from December 31, 2019, to March 30, 2022, for studies 
      of NPI efficacy on dengue infection. We obtained the annual reported dengue cases
      from highly dengue-endemic countries in 2015-2021 from the European Centre for
      Disease Prevention and Control to determine the actual change in dengue cases in 
      2020 and 2021, respectively. A random-effects estimate of the pooled odds was
      generated with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Between-study heterogeneity was
      assessed using the inconsistency index (I(2) ) and subgroup analysis according to
      country (dengue-endemic or non-endemic) was conducted. This review was registered
      with PROSPERO (CRD42021291487). A total of 17 articles covering 32 countries or
      regions were included in the review. Meta-analysis estimated a pooled relative
      risk of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.28-0.55), and subgroup revealed 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.25) 
      and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.44-0.68) in dengue non-endemic areas and dengue-endemic
      countries, respectively, in 2020. The majority of highly dengue-endemic countries
      in Asia and Americas reported 0-100% reductions in dengue cases in 2020 compared 
      to previous years, while some countries (4/20) reported a dramatic increase,
      resulting in an overall increase of 11%. In contrast, there was an obvious
      reduction in dengue cases in 2021 in almost all countries (18/20) studied, with
      an overall 40% reduction rate. The overall effectiveness of NPIs on dengue varied
      with region and time due to multiple factors, but most countries reported
      significant reductions. Travel-related interventions demonstrated great
      effectiveness for reducing imported cases of dengue fever. Internal movement
      restrictions of constantly varying intensity and range are more likely to
      mitigate the entire level of dengue transmission by reducing the spread of dengue
      fever between regions within a country, which is useful for developing a more
      comprehensive and sustainable strategy for preventing and controlling dengue
      fever in the future.

AB  - Flaviviruses comprise a large group of arboviral species that are distributed in 
      several countries of the tropics, neotropics, and some temperate zones. Since
      they can produce neurological pathologies or vascular damage, there has been
      intense research seeking better diagnosis and treatments for their infections in 
      the last decades. The flavivirus NS1 protein is a relevant clinical target
      because it is involved in viral replication, immune evasion, and virulence. Being
      a key factor in endothelial and tissue-specific modulation, NS1 has been largely 
      studied to understand the molecular mechanisms exploited by the virus to
      reprogram host cells. A central part of the viral maturation processes is the NS1
      oligomerization because many stages rely on these protein-protein assemblies. In 
      the present study, the self-associations of NS1 proteins from Zika, Dengue, and
      West Nile viruses are examined through constant-pH coarse-grained biophysical
      simulations. Free energies of interactions were estimated for different
      oligomeric states and pH conditions. Our results show that these proteins can
      form both dimers and tetramers under conditions near physiological pH even
      without the presence of lipids. Moreover, pH plays an important role mainly
      controlling the regimes where van der Waals interactions govern their
      association. Finally, despite the similarity at the sequence level, we found that
      each flavivirus has a well-characteristic protein-protein interaction profile.
      These specific features can provide new hints for the development of binders both
      for better diagnostic tools and the formulation of new therapeutic drugs.

TI  - Scanning electron microscopy for identification of local strain of Aspergillus
      Parasiticus and its larvicidal efficacy against Aedes Aegypti and non-target
      toxicity testing on fingerlings of Hypophthalmichthys Molitrix.
LID - 10.1002/jemt.24176 [doi]
AB  - Scanning electron microscopy proved to be helpful in identification of
      Aspergillus parasiticus. A. parasiticus has a worldwide occurrence with high
      entomopathogenic efficacy against Aedes aegypti. However, assessment of
      pathogenic effects of entomopathogenic fungi on non-target organisms is required 
      to evaluate its use as bio control agent. Aim of the present research is to study
      the parricidal activity of the local strain of A. parasiticus (MK371710) against 
      A. aegypti and its toxicity assessment against aquatic model organism
      Hypophthalmichthys molitrix. A. parasiticus was isolated from the soil of Jallo
      Park, Lahore. The larvicidal effect of A. parasiticus was evaluated against
      fourth instar larvae of A. aegypti. Hundred percent of mortality of larvae was
      observed after exposure to 1 x 10(7) conidia/ml of fungal suspension after 72 h
      post treatment. The LC50 value of A. parsiticus in 24 h post treatment and 48 h
      post treatment was recorded as 1.0 x 10(7) conidia/ml 2.99 x 10(5) conidia/ml,
      respectively. However, an in-depth understanding safety to non-target organisms
      is necessary, if we are to properly control the action of these entomopathogenic 
      fungi under natural conditions. For the toxicity assessment fingerlings of H.
      molitrix were exposed to conidial suspensions of A. parasiticus. Eye pop (64%),
      fin hemorrhage (33%), and scale infection (30%) were the major morphological
      effects observed during the study. Results reveal that although A. parasiticus is
      highly pathogenic to dengue vector but also have significant effects on organisms
      other than insects and its application as biological control agent requires
      safety considerations.

AB  - Ribavirin is an unnatural nucleoside exhibiting broad spectrum of antiviral and
      antitumor activities, still very widely studied particularly in a repositioning
      approach. C-triazolyl nucleoside analogues of ribavirin have been synthesized, as
      well as prodrugs and glycosylated or peptide conjugates to allow a better
      activity by vectorization into the liver or by facilitating uptake into the
      cells. The antiviral properties of all synthesized compounds have been evaluated 
      in vitro against two important human viral pathogens belonging to the
      Flaviviridae family: hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). There are no 
      therapeutic options for Zika virus, whereas those available for HCV can be still 
      improved. Our results indicated that compound 2 carrying an N-hydroxy carboxamide
      function exhibits the most inhibitory activities against both viruses. This
      compound moderately inhibited the propagation of HCV with an IC50 value of 49.1
      muM and Zika virus with an IC50 of 33.2 muM comparable to ribavirin in the Vero
      cell line. The results suggest that compound 2 and its new derivatives may be
      candidates for further development of new anti-HCV and anti-ZIKV antiviral drugs.

      enabling HCR hairpin probes to easily access the target site. The 24-nt conserved
      sequence within 3'-UTR, present only in dengue virus genome but not in other
      species, is an ideal target to use as a probe binding site for pan-dengue virus
      detection. Thus, the 105-nt target containing the 24-nt target sequence was
      chosen as a target with secondary structures. The 24-nucleotide (nt) synthetic
      target DNA successfully induced HCR reaction within 5 min at room temperature.
      However, the HCR detection of the 105-nt synthetic target DNA with secondary
      structures was problematic. The probe hybridization was prevented by the
      secondary structures of the target, resulting in a failure to generate HCR
      product. To solve this problem, two helper oligonucleotides (helper1 and helper2)
      were designed to linearize the folded structure of the 105-nt target through
      strand-displacement mechanism, allowing the HCR hairpin probes to easily access
      the target site. The HCR product with the labeled helper oligonucleotides and the
      labeled probes were successfully detected by LFIA. With this strategy, the
      combination of the helper-enhanced HCR and LFIA exhibited a limit of detection
      (LOD) in a nanomolar range of the 105-nt DENV synthetic target DNA. Our study
      demonstrated that signal amplification by the combination of HCR and LFIA could
      successfully detect the target DNA with secondary structure, but not target RNA
      with secondary structure. In summary, this work provided a proof of concept of
      two main issues including probe hybridization enhancement by helper
      oligonucleotide for the target with complicated secondary structure and the
      advantage of a combination of labeled helper and HCR probes design for LFIA to
      overcome the false positive result from HCR probe leakage. Our findings on the
      use of helper oligonucleotides may be beneficial for the development of other
      isothermal amplification, since the secondary structure of the target is one of
      the major obstacles among hybridization-based methods.

AB  - A new virus, named Mutum virus, related to members of the family Tymoviridae, was
      isolated from mosquitoes (Mansonia spp.) in clone C6/36 cells, and its complete
      genome was sequenced. Its genome is 6494 nt in size with an organization
      resembling that of tymovirids. The isolated virus is phylogenetically related to 
      two viruses isolated from Culex spp. mosquitoes: Ek Balam virus, reported in
      Mexico, and Culex-originated Tymoviridae-like virus, isolated in China. The
      results of this study suggest that this virus is a new member of the family
      Tymoviridae.

TI  - Accuracy and efficacy of pre-dengue vaccination screening for previous dengue
      infection with a new dengue rapid diagnostic test: a retrospective analysis of
      phase 3 efficacy trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A dengue pre-vaccination test that is convenient, highly specific,
      and highly sensitive is still needed. The OnSite Dengue IgG rapid diagnostic test
      (RDT) is a new rapid diagnostic test specifically designed for pre-vaccination
      screening. We aimed to retrospectively assess the efficacy of a tetravalent
      dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) in participants determined to be dengue seropositive by 
      the OnSite IgG RDT and to evaluate assay performances. METHODS: This was a
      complementary study using pre-vaccination samples from two CYD-TDV efficacy
      trials done in five countries in the Asia-Pacific region (NCT01373281) and five
      countries in Latin America (NCT01374516). Baseline dengue serostatus was
      determined by the OnSite IgG RDT on samples from the immunogenicity subsets of
      the two trials. In participants who were test positive, we calculated CYD-TDV
      vaccine efficacy against symptomatic virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) over 25
      months, and against hospitalisation with VCD over 72 months of follow-up after
      the first vaccination. We used a reference algorithm to determine the reference
      dengue serostatus for each sample, and sensitivity and specificity of the OnSite 
      IgG RDT were calculated. Analyses were done on the whole population (aged 2-16
      years), and on those aged 6 years or older and those aged 9 years or older.
      FINDINGS: Of 3983 participants in the immunogenicity subsets of the efficacy
      trials CYD14 and CYD15, 3962 had complete dengue reference test results enabling 
      baseline serostatus classification and 3833 had sufficient serum samples
      remaining for evaluation with the OnSite IgG RDT. Of the samples tested, 2486
      (64.9%) of 3833 were OnSite IgG RDT-positive. In participants aged 2-16 years who
      were OnSite IgG RDT-positive, vaccine efficacy was 84.1% (95% CI 71.6-91.1)
      against symptomatic VCD, and 69.2% (38.8-84.5) against hospitalisation with VCD, 
      with similar findings in those aged 6 years or older and those aged 9 years or
      older. The OnSite IgG RDT showed very high sensitivity (91.1%, 89.9-92.1) and
      high specificity (92.8%, 91.2-94.2) in participants aged 2-16 years, with
      significantly higher specificity in those aged 9 years or older (96.6%,
      94.9-97.8). INTERPRETATION: The OnSite IgG RDT should provide a valuable tool for
      screening for previous dengue infection at the point of vaccination. In
      individuals who were OnSite IgG RDT-positive, the vaccine efficacy of CYD-TDV was
      high across all three age groups. FUNDING: Sanofi Pasteur.

TI  - Acute appendicitis during the recovery phase of dengue hemorrhagic fever: two
      case reports.
PG  - 219
LID - 10.1186/s13256-022-03443-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is one of the most common tropical diseases, with high
      prevalence in many tropical countries including Sri Lanka. Dengue infection can
      present from subclinical infection to dengue shock syndrome. Further, the disease
      also shows a variety of atypical presentations and has been reported to mimic a
      number of causes of acute abdomen. CASE PRESENTATION: The authors report two
      children (a 6-year-old Tamil girl and an 8-year-old Muslim girl) who were
      diagnosed to have acute appendicitis during the early recovery phase of dengue
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and late recovery period of dengue hemorrhagic fever with
      platelet count of 92 x 10(3)/cumm and 102 x 10(3)/cumm, respectively. Both
      children were investigated with abdomen ultrasound as they developed severe
      abdominal pain and tenderness on palpation during the recovery phase, which was
      felt to be very unusual. Acute appendicitis was diagnosed in one child, while the
      other child had a ruptured appendicular abscess. Both children were treated with 
      laparoscopic appendectomy and a 7-day course of intravenous antibiotics. Both
      children were reviewed in 1 month following treatment and had complete recovery. 
      CONCLUSION: Although precise pathophysiology and associations of the surgical
      abdomen with dengue fever remain to be elucidated, there are known factors in
      dengue fever that can potentially lead to secondary bacterial infections and
      surgical abdomen. Awareness and increased suspicion by the clinician are
      paramount to detect such complications early, especially in children who
      demonstrate unusual clinical features during various stages of dengue infection.

TI  - Inkoo and Sindbis viruses in blood sucking insects, and a serological study for
      Inkoo virus in semi-domesticated Eurasian tundra reindeer in Norway.
PG  - 99
LID - 10.1186/s12985-022-01815-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne viruses pose a serious threat to humans worldwide.
      There has been an upsurge in the number of mosquito-borne viruses in Europe,
      mostly belonging to the families Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus (Sindbis,
      Chikungunya), Flaviviridae (West Nile, Usutu, Dengue), and Peribunyaviridae,
      genus Orthobunyavirus, California serogroup (Inkoo, Batai, Tahyna). The principal
      focus of this study was Inkoo (INKV) and Sindbis (SINV) virus circulating in
      Norway, Sweden, Finland, and some parts of Russia. These viruses are associated
      with morbidity in humans. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding reservoirs 
      and transmission. Therefore, we aimed to determine the prevalence of INKV and
      SINV in blood sucking insects and seroprevalence for INKV in semi-domesticated
      Eurasian tundra reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Norway. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: In total, 213 pools containing about 25 blood sucking insects (BSI) each
      and 480 reindeer sera were collected in eight Norwegian reindeer summer pasture
      districts during 2013-2015. The pools were analysed by RT-PCR to detect INKV and 
      by RT-real-time PCR for SINV. Reindeer sera were analysed for INKV-specific IgG
      by an Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (n = 480, IIFA) and a Plaque Reduction
      Neutralization Test (n = 60, PRNT). RESULTS: Aedes spp. were the most dominant
      species among the collected BSI. Two of the pools were positive for INKV-RNA by
      RT-PCR and were confirmed by pyrosequencing. The overall estimated pool
      prevalence (EPP) of INKV in Norway was 0.04%. None of the analysed pools were
      positive for SINV. Overall IgG seroprevalence in reindeer was 62% positive for
      INKV by IIFA. Of the 60 reindeer sera- analysed by PRNT for INKV, 80% were
      confirmed positive, and there was no cross-reactivity with the closely related
      Tahyna virus (TAHV) and Snowshoe hare virus (SSHV). CONCLUSION: The occurrence
      and prevalence of INKV in BSI and the high seroprevalence against the virus among
      semi-domesticated reindeer in Norway indicate that further studies are required
      for monitoring this virus. SINV was not detected in the BSI in this study,
      however, human cases of SINV infection are yearly reported from other regions
      such as Rjukan in south-central Norway. It is therefore essential to monitor both
      viruses in the human population. Our findings are important to raise awareness
      regarding the geographical distribution of these mosquito-borne viruses in
      Northern Europe.

TI  - Impact of a spatial repellent product on Anopheles and non-Anopheles mosquitoes
      in Sumba, Indonesia.
PG  - 166
LID - 10.1186/s12936-022-04185-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The East Nusa Tenggara province, Indonesia, contributed to 5% of
      malaria cases nationally in 2020, with other mosquito-borne diseases, such as
      dengue and filariasis also being endemic. Monitoring of spatial and temporal
      vector species compositions and bionomic traits is an efficient method for
      generating evidence towards intervention strategy optimization and meeting
      disease elimination goals. METHODS: The impact of a spatial repellent (SR) on
      human biting mosquitoes was evaluated as part of a parent cluster-randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, in Sumba, East Nusa Tenggara. A
      10-month (June 2015-March 2016) baseline study was followed by a 24-month
      intervention period (April 2016 to April 2018)-where half the clusters were
      randomly assigned either a passive transfluthrin emanator or a placebo control.
      RESULTS: Human-landing mosquito catches documented a reduction in landing rates
      related to the SR. Overall, there was a 16.4% reduction (21% indoors, and 11.3%
      outdoors) in human biting rates (HBR) for Anopheles. For Aedes, there was a 44.3%
      HBR reduction indoors and a 35.6% reduction outdoors. This reduction was 38.3%
      indoors and 39.1% outdoors for Armigeres, and 36.0% indoors and 32.3% outdoors
      for Culex species. Intervention impacts on the HBRs were not significant and are 
      attributed to large inter-household and inter cluster variation. Anopheles
      flavirostris, Anopheles balabacensis and Anopheles maculatus individually
      impacted the overall malaria infections hazard rate with statistically
      significance. Though there was SR-based protection against malaria for all
      Anopheles species (except Anopheles sundaicus), only five (Anopheles aconitus,
      Anopheles kochi, Anopheles tessellatus, An. maculatus and An. sundaicus)
      demonstrated statistical significance. The SR numerically reduced Anopheles
      parity rates indoors and outdoors when compared to the placebo. CONCLUSION:
      Evidence demonstrating that Anopheles vectors bite both indoors and outdoors
      indicates that currently implemented indoor-based vector control tools may not be
      sufficient to eliminate malaria. The documented impact of the SR intervention on 
      Aedes, Armigeres and Culex species points to its importance in combatting other
      vector borne diseases. Studies to determine the impact of spatial repellents on
      other mosquito-borne diseases is recommended.

TI  - Armigeres subalbatus is a potential vector for Zika virus but not dengue virus.
PG  - 62
LID - 10.1186/s40249-022-00990-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are closely related
      flaviviruses primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Armigeres subalbatus is
      an emerging and widely distributed mosquito, and ZIKV has been detected and
      isolated from it. However, it is not clear whether Ar. subalbatus could be a
      vector for ZIKV and DENV or not. In this study, we investigated the infection and
      transmission of Ar. subalbatus to ZIKV and DENV. METHODS: A line of Ar.
      subalbatus was isolated from Guangdong, China, and further identified by the
      mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene. The adults of Ar.
      subalbatus were fed with blood meal containing ZIKV or DENV-2. At 4, 7, 10, 14,
      and 21 days post-inoculation (dpi), the infections of ZIKV or DENV-2 in the
      midguts, ovaries and salivary glands were detected and quantified by RT-PCR and
      RT-qPCR. To assess the transmissibility, suckling mice were exposed to bites of
      ZIKV-infected mosquitoes, and ZIKV was detected in brain tissue by RT-qPCR and
      plaque assays. Furthermore, the larvae of Ar. subalbatus were reared in
      artificial urine containing ZIKV or DENV-2. The infection rates and viral titers 
      of larvae and adults were analyzed by RT-PCR and RT-qPCR, and the viral
      distribution in larval tissues was observed by immunohistochemistry. Chi-square
      test and one-way ANOVA analysis were used for assessing the infection rate and
      viral titer in varied tissues and different time points, respectively. RESULTS:
      Following oral inoculation, ZIKV but not DENV-2 could be detected in Ar.
      subalbatus midguts at 4 dpi, ovaries at 7 dpi and salivary glands at 10 dpi. The 
      highest infection rate (IR) of ZIKV was 27.8% in midgut at 7 dpi, 9.7% in ovary
      and 5.6% in salivary gland at 21 dpi. Eight days after being bitten by
      ZIKV-positive mosquitoes, ZIKV was detected in three brain tissues out of four
      suckling mice exposed to bites. ZIKV could be detected in the larvae reared in
      artificial urine contained ZIKV at a high concentration of 10(5) pfu/ml and
      various tissues of adults with a low infection rate (0.70-1.35%). ZIKV could be
      observed in anal papillae and midgut of larvae at 4 dpi under laboratory
      conditions. CONCLUSIONS: ZIKV but not DENV-2 can infect Ar. subalbatus by blood
      meal and artificial urine, and the infected mosquitoes can transmit ZIKV to
      suckling mice by bite. From these findings, we can conclude that the Ar.
      subalbatus isolated from Guangdong province, China, is a potential vector for
      ZIKV and should therefore be considered in vector control programs to prevent and
      control of Zika virus disease.

TI  - A Poisson-multinomial spatial model for simultaneous outbreaks with application

PG  - 1590-1602

AB  - Dengue, Zika, and chikungunya are arboviral diseases (AVD) transmitted mainly by 
      Aedes aegypti. Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil, has been endemic for dengue for over 
      30 years, and experienced the first joint epidemic of the three diseases between 
      2015-2016. They present similar symptoms and only a small proportion of cases are
      laboratory-confirmed. These facts lead to potential misdiagnosis and,
      consequently, uncertainty in the registration of the cases. We have available the
      number of cases of each disease for the n=160 neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro. We
      propose a Poisson model for the total number of cases of Aedes-borne diseases
      and, conditioned on the total, we assume a multinomial model for the allocation
      of the number of cases of each of the diseases across the neighborhoods. This
      provides simultaneously the estimation of the associations of the relative risk
      of the total cases of AVD with environmental and socioeconomic variables; and the
      estimation of the probability of presence of each disease as a function of
      available covariates. Our findings suggest that a one standard deviation increase
      in the social development index decreases the relative risk of the total cases of
      AVD by 28%. Neighborhoods with smaller proportion of green area had greater odds 
      of having chikungunya in comparison to dengue and Zika. A one standard deviation 
      increase in population density decreases the odds of a neighborhood having Zika
      instead of dengue by 18% but increases the odds of chikungunya in comparison to
      dengue by 18% and by 43% in comparison to Zika.

TI  - Addressing delayed case reporting in infectious disease forecast modeling.
PG  - e1010115
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010115 [doi]
AB  - Infectious disease forecasting is of great interest to the public health
      community and policymakers, since forecasts can provide insight into disease
      dynamics in the near future and inform interventions. Due to delays in case
      reporting, however, forecasting models may often underestimate the current and
      future disease burden. In this paper, we propose a general framework for
      addressing reporting delay in disease forecasting efforts with the goal of
      improving forecasts. We propose strategies for leveraging either historical data 
      on case reporting or external internet-based data to estimate the amount of
      reporting error. We then describe several approaches for adapting general
      forecasting pipelines to account for under- or over-reporting of cases. We apply 
      these methods to address reporting delay in data on dengue fever cases in Puerto 
      Rico from 1990 to 2009 and to reports of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the
      United States between 2010 and 2019. Through a simulation study, we compare
      method performance and evaluate robustness to assumption violations. Our results 
      show that forecasting accuracy and prediction coverage almost always increase
      when correction methods are implemented to address reporting delay. Some of these
      methods required knowledge about the reporting error or high quality external
      data, which may not always be available. Provided alternatives include excluding 
      recently-reported data and performing sensitivity analysis. This work provides
      intuition and guidance for handling delay in disease case reporting and may serve
      as a useful resource to inform practical infectious disease forecasting efforts.

TI  - The Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 (NS1) Interacts with the Putative
      Epigenetic Regulator DIDO1 to Promote Flavivirus Replication in Mosquito Cells.
PG  - e0070422
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00704-22 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) NS1 is a multifunctional protein essential for viral
      replication. To gain insights into NS1 functions in mosquito cells, the protein
      interactome of DENV NS1 in C6/36 cells was investigated using a proximity
      biotinylation system and mass spectrometry. A total of 817 mosquito targets were 
      identified as protein-protein interacting with DENV NS1. Approximately 14% of
      them coincide with interactomes previously obtained in vertebrate cells,
      including the oligosaccharide transferase complex, the chaperonin containing
      TCP-1, vesicle localization, and ribosomal proteins. Notably, other protein
      pathways not previously reported in vertebrate cells, such as epigenetic
      regulation and RNA silencing, were also found in the NS1 interactome in mosquito 
      cells. Due to the novel and strong interactions observed for NS1 and the
      epigenetic regulator DIDO1 (Death-Inducer Obliterator 1), the role of DIDO1 in
      viral replication was further explored. Interactions between NS1 and DIDO1 were
      corroborated in infected mosquito cells, by colocalization and proximity ligation
      assays. Silencing DIDO1 expression results in a significant reduction in DENV and
      ZIKV replication and progeny production. Comparison of transcription analysis of 
      mock or DENV infected cells silenced for DIDO1 revealed variations in multiple
      gene expression pathways, including pathways associated with DENV infection such 
      as RNA surveillance, IMD, and Toll. These results suggest that DIDO1 is a host
      factor involved in the negative modulation of the antiviral response necessary
      for flavivirus replication in mosquito cells. Our findings uncover novel
      mechanisms of NS1 to promote DENV and ZIKV replication, and add to the
      understanding of NS1 as a multifunctional protein. IMPORTANCE Dengue is the most 
      important mosquito-borne viral disease to humans. Dengue virus NS1 is a
      multifunctional protein essential for replication and modulation of innate
      immunity. To gain insights into NS1 functions, the protein interactome of dengue 
      virus NS1 in Aedes albopictus cells was investigated using a proximity
      biotinylation system and mass spectrometry. Several protein pathways, not
      previously observed in vertebrate cells, such as transcription and epigenetic
      regulation, were found as part of the NS1 interactome in mosquito cells. Among
      those, DIDO1 was found to be a necessary host factor for dengue and Zika virus
      replication in mosquito cells. Transcription analysis of infected mosquito cells 
      silenced for DIDO1 revealed alterations of the IMD and Toll pathways, part of the
      antiviral response in mosquitoes. The results suggest that DIDO1 is a host factor
      involved in modulation of the antiviral response and necessary for flavivirus
      replication.

TI  - Modifying mosquitoes to suppress disease transmission: Is the long wait over?
LID - iyac072 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/genetics/iyac072 [doi]
AB  - For more than 50 years it has been a dream of medical entomologists and public
      health workers to control diseases like malaria and dengue fever by modifying,
      through genetics and other methods, the arthropods that transmit them to humans. 
      A brief synopsis of the history of these efforts as applied to mosquitoes is
      presented; none proved to be effective in reducing disease prevalence. Only in
      the last few years have novel approaches been developed or proposed that indicate
      the long wait may be over. Three recent developments are particularly promising: 
      CRISPR-Cas9 driven genetic modification, shifting naturally occurring allele
      frequencies, and microbe-based modifications. The last is the furthest along in
      implementation. Dengue fever incidence has been reduced between 40% and 96% in 4 
      different regions of the world where Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti have been
      established in the field. It is not yet clear how sustainable such control
      programs will prove to be, but there is good reason for optimism. In light of
      this, the time is ripe for reinvigorated research on vectors, especially
      genetics. Vector-borne diseases primarily affect under-developed countries and
      thus have not received the attention they deserve from wealthier countries with
      well-developed and funded biomedical research establishments.

TI  - Association of systemic vitamin D on the course of dengue virus infection in
      adults: a single-centre dengue cohort study at a large institution in Singapore.
LID - 10.11622/smedj.2022064 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Host immune responses may impact dengue severity in adults. Vitamin
      D has multiple immunomodulatory effects on innate and adaptive immunity. METHODS:
      We evaluated the association between systemic 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-(OH) D] and
      dengue disease severity in adults. We measured plasma for total 25-(OH) D levels 
      with an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using stored samples from
      participants with laboratory confirmed dengue who were prospectively enrolled in 
      2012-2016 at our institution. RESULTS: 80 participants (median age 43 years) were
      enrolled. Six participants had severe dengue based on the World Health
      Organisation (WHO) 1997 criteria (i.e. dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock
      syndrome) and another six had severe dengue based on the WHO 2009 criteria.
      Median 25-(OH) D at acute phase of dengue was 6.175 microg/L (interquartile range
      3.82-8.21; range 3.00-15.29) in all participants. 25-(OH) D showed inverse linear
      trend with severe dengue manifestations based on the WHO 2009 criteria (aRR 0.72;
      95% confidence interval 0.57-0.91; p < 0.01) after adjustment for age, gender and
      ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Limited studies have evaluated the role of systemic
      25-(OH) D on dengue severity. Our study found low systemic 25-(OH) D was
      associated with increased dengue disease severity, particularly for severe
      bleeding that was not explained by thrombocytopenia. Further studies
      investigating the underlying immune mechanisms and effects on the vascular
      endothelium are needed.

TI  - A systematic review to describe patterns of animal and human viral research in
      Rwanda.
LID - ihac031 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/inthealth/ihac031 [doi]
AB  - Rwanda is located in the Central East African region where several viral
      pathogens with global importance were originally described, including human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, Zika, Rift Valley Fever (RVF), dengue and a 
      long list of other neglected tropical viral pathogens. Due to many factors, this 
      region has the potential to become a global hotspot for viral emergence. In
      Rwanda, viral diseases are underreported and the question is whether this is due 
      to the absence of these viruses or a lack of investigation. Like many developing 
      countries, capabilities in Rwanda need improvement despite research efforts
      throughout the years. This review describes the status of human and animal virus 
      research in Rwanda and identifies relevant research and operational gaps. A
      comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed for virus research in Rwanda: 233
      primary studies on viruses/viral diseases are indexed with connection to Rwanda. 
      From 1958 to 2020, yearly publications generally increased and HIV/acquired
      immunodeficiency syndrome is the most studied virus. Compared with human viruses,
      few studies focus on animal and/or zoonotic viruses. The occurrence of the
      current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic shows
      strengthening warning and surveillance systems is critical to efficient
      preparedness and response. We recommend investment in human capacity, laboratory 
      facilities and research to inform policy for viral surveillance in Rwanda.

TI  - Modeling the impact of genetically modified male mosquitoes in the spatial
      population dynamics of Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 9112
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-12764-7 [doi]
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of diseases such as dengue,
      Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Improving control techniques requires a
      better understanding of the mosquito's life cycle, including spatial population
      dynamics in endemic regions. One of the most promising techniques consists of
      introducing genetically modified male mosquitoes. Several models proposed to
      describe this technique present mathematical issues or rely on numerous
      parameters, making their application challenging to real-world situations. We
      propose a model describing the spatial population dynamics of the Aedes aegypti
      in the presence of genetically modified males. This model presents some
      mathematical improvements compared to the literature allowing deeper mathematical
      analysis. Moreover, this model relies on few parameters, which we show how to
      obtain or estimate from the literature. Through numerical simulations, we
      investigate the impacts of environmental heterogeneity, the periodicity of
      genetically modified male releases, and released genetically modified males
      quantity on the population dynamics of Aedes aegypti. The main results point to
      that the successful application of this vector control technique relies on
      releasing more than a critical amount of modified males with a frequency
      exceeding a specific critical value.

AB  - Physiological blood-tissue barriers play a critical role in separating the
      circulation from immune-privileged sites and denying access to blood-borne
      viruses. The mechanism of virus restriction by these barriers is poorly
      understood. We utilize induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human brain
      microvascular endothelial cells (iBMECs) to study virus-blood-brain barrier (BBB)
      interactions. These iPSC-derived cells faithfully recapitulate a striking
      difference in in vivo neuroinvasion by two alphavirus isolates and are
      selectively permissive to neurotropic flaviviruses. A model of cocultured iBMECs 
      and astrocytes exhibits high transendothelial electrical resistance and blocks
      non-neurotropic flaviviruses from getting across the barrier. We find that iBMECs
      constitutively express an interferon-induced gene, IFITM1, which preferentially
      restricts the replication of non-neurotropic flaviviruses. Barrier cells from
      blood-testis and blood-retinal barriers also constitutively express IFITMs that
      contribute to the viral resistance. Our application of a renewable human
      iPSC-based model for studying virus-BBB interactions reveals that intrinsic
      immunity at the barriers contributes to virus exclusion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the urban arboviruses (dengue, zika and chikungunya)
      stratification methodology by the territorial receptivity Index, an instrument
      for the surveillance and control of these diseases, which considers the
      heterogeneity of an intra-municipal territory. METHODS: Ecological study that
      uses as unit of analysis the areas covered by health centers in Belo Horizonte.
      For the development of a territorial receptivity index, indicators of
      socio-environmental determination of urban arboviruses were selected in order to 
      integrate the analysis of main components. The resulting components were weighted
      by the analytic hierarchy process and combined via map algebra. RESULTS: The
      territorial receptivity index showed great heterogeneity of urban infrastructure 
      conditions. The areas classified with high and very high receptivity correspond
      to approximately 33% of the occupied area and are mainly concentrated in the
      administrative planning regions of East, Northeast, North, West, and Barreiro,
      especially in areas surrounding the municipality. When the density of dengue
      cases and Aedes eggs, from 2016, were superimposed with the stratification by the
      index of territorial receptivity to urban arboviruses, areas of very high
      receptivity had a high density of cases and Aedes eggs - higher than that
      observed in other areas of the city, which corresponds to a very small percentage
      of the municipal territory (13.5%). CONCLUSION: The analyses indicate the need
      for the development of adequate surveillance and control actions for each
      context, overcoming the logic of homogeneous allocation throughout the territory.

TI  - Efficacy of rupatadine in reducing the incidence of dengue haemorrhagic fever in 
      patients with acute dengue: A randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - e0010123
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rupatadine was previously shown to reduce endothelial dysfunction in 
      vitro, reduced vascular leak in dengue mouse models and to reduce the extent of
      pleural effusions and thrombocytopenia in patients with acute dengue. Therefore, 
      we sought to determine the efficacy of rupatadine in reducing the incidence of
      dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) in patients with acute dengue. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: A phase 2, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial 
      was carried out in patients with acute dengue in Sri Lanka in an outpatient
      setting. Patients with </=3 days since the onset of illness were either recruited
      to the treatment arm of oral rupatadine 40mg for 5 days (n = 123) or the placebo 
      arm (n = 126). Clinical and laboratory features were measured daily to assess
      development of DHF and other complications. 12 (9.7%) patients developed DHF in
      the treatment arm compared to 22 (17.5%) who were on the placebo although this
      was not significant (p = 0.09, relative risk 0.68, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.08).
      Rupatadine also significantly reduced (p = 0.01) the proportion of patients with 
      platelet counts <50,000 cells/mm3 and significantly reduced (p = 0.04) persisting
      vomiting, headache and hepatic tenderness (p<0.0001) in patients. There was a
      significant difference in the duration of illness (p = 0.0002) although the
      proportion of individuals who required hospital admission in both treatment arms.
      Only 2 patients on rupatadine and 3 patients on the placebo developed shock,
      while bleeding manifestations were seen in 6 patients on rupatadine and 7
      patients on the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Rupatadine appeared to be safe and well
      tolerated and showed a trend towards a reducing proportion of patients with acute
      dengue who developed DHF. Its usefulness when used in combination with other
      treatment modalities should be explored. TRIAL REGISTRATION: International
      Clinical Trials Registration Platform: SLCTR/2017/024.

TI  - Simple and Economical Extraction of Viral RNA and Storage at Ambient Temperature.
PG  - e0085922
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00859-22 [doi]
AB  - RNA extraction is essential for the molecular detection of common viral
      pathogens. However, available extraction methods and the need for ultra-cold
      storage limit molecular testing in resource-constrained settings. Herein, we
      describe the development of an economical RNA Extraction and Storage (RNAES)
      protocol that eliminates requirements for instrumentation, expensive materials,
      and preserved cold chain. Through an iterative process, we optimized viral lysis 
      and RNA binding to and elution from glass fiber membranes included in simple
      RNAES packets. Efficient viral lysis was achieved with a nontoxic buffer
      containing sucrose, KCl, proteinase K, and carrier RNA. Viral RNA binding to
      glass fiber membranes was concentration dependent across seven orders of
      magnitude (4.0-10.0 log10 copies/muL) and significantly increased with an acidic 
      arginine binding buffer. For the clinical evaluation, 36 dengue virus
      (DENV)-positive serum samples were extracted in duplicate with the optimized
      RNAES protocol and once in an EMAG instrument (bioMerieux). DENV RNA was
      successfully extracted from 71/72 replicates (98.6%) in the RNAES protocol, and
      real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold (CT) values correlated between extraction
      methods. DENV RNA, extracted from clinical samples, was stable when stored on
      dried RNAES membranes at ambient temperature for up to 35 days, with median
      eluate RNA concentration decreasing by 0.18 and 0.29 log10 copies/muL between day
      0 and days 7 and 35, respectively. At a cost of $0.08/sample, RNAES packets
      address key limitations to available protocols and may increase capacity for
      molecular detection of RNA viruses. IMPORTANCE RNA extraction methods and
      ultra-cold storage requirements limit molecular testing for common viruses. We
      developed a simple, flexible, and economical method that simultaneously addresses
      these limitations. At $0.08/sample, the new RNA Extraction and Storage (RNAES)
      protocol successfully extracted viral RNA from acute-phase sera and provided
      stable, ambient-temperature RNA storage for 35 days. Using this approach, we
      expect to improve RNA virus detection and outbreak response in
      resource-constrained settings.

TI  - Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis - A Common Ramification of Different
      Diseases.
PG  - 63-69
AB  - Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rare and potentially fatal disorder
      caused by immune dysregulation. It can occur as a primary genetic disease or
      secondarily due to various causes including infections, malignancies or
      autoimmune diseases. In this case report, we present two cases of Hemophagocytic 
      lymphohistiocytosis which were secondary to typhoid and dengue fever. While
      primary disease occurs predominantly in infants, secondary hemophagocytic
      lymphohistiocytosis can occur in any age group. Both primary and secondary
      hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are characterised by fever,
      hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia and multiorgan dysfunction. But unusual
      persistence of fever and other organ involvement should need further workup for
      hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
      may resolve on treating the underlying disorder. But severe cases need treatment 
      with immunosuppressive/immunomodulation therapy to prevent morbidity. Early
      clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis and treatment of hemophagocytic
      lymphohistiocytosis are essential to prevent deleterious effects to health.

TI  - Spontaneous spinal intradural hemorrhage in dengue fever: a case report.
PG  - 213
LID - 10.1186/s13256-022-03451-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spontaneous spinal cord hemorrhage is extremely rare in dengue fever.
      We report a case of spontaneous spinal intradural hemorrhage in dengue fever
      associated with severe thrombocytopenia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old Indian 
      woman presented with fever and body aches followed by acute onset of paraplegia
      with bladder and bowel dysfunction and loss of sensations below the level of the 
      umbilicus. She had severe thrombocytopenia and positive dengue serology. Magnetic
      resonance imaging of the spine showed compression of the spinal cord due to
      intradural hematoma at the D7-D8 vertebral level. The patient received
      symptomatic treatment for dengue fever and steroids. Emergency D7-D8 laminectomy 
      with excision of the clot and dural repair was done after stabilizing the
      platelet count with multiple platelet transfusions. The constitutional symptoms
      responded well to the treatment. There was good improvement in sensory symptoms
      but negligible improvement in paraplegia with a change in muscle power from grade
      0/5 to grade 1/5 in the postoperative period. The patient was discharged from the
      hospital in a stable condition, but paraplegia showed little improvement during
      follow-up of 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous spinal cord hemorrhage can present 
      as acute paraplegia in dengue fever. Failure to recognize this complication can
      delay initiating appropriate treatment with permanent loss of neurologic
      function.

AB  - Surveillance is a critical component of any dengue prevention and control
      program. There is an increasing effort to use drones in mosquito control
      surveillance. Due to the novelty of drones, data are scarce on the impact and
      acceptance of their use in the communities to collect health-related data. The
      use of drones raises concerns about the protection of human privacy. Here, we
      show how willingness to be trained and acceptance of drone use in tech-savvy
      communities can help further discussions in mosquito surveillance. A
      cross-sectional study was conducted in Malaysia, Mexico, and Turkey to assess
      knowledge of diseases caused by Aedes mosquitoes, perceptions about drone use for
      data collection, and acceptance of drones for Aedes mosquito surveillance around 
      homes. Compared with people living in Turkey, Mexicans had 14.3 (p < 0.0001)
      times higher odds and Malaysians had 4.0 (p = 0.7030) times the odds of being
      willing to download a mosquito surveillance app. Compared to urban dwellers,
      rural dwellers had 1.56 times the odds of being willing to be trained. There is
      widespread community support for drone use in mosquito surveillance and this
      community buy-in suggests a potential for success in mosquito surveillance using 
      drones. A successful surveillance and community engagement system may be used to 
      monitor a variety of mosquito spp. Future research should include qualitative
      interview data to add context to these findings.

AB  - Dengue has been endemic in Yogyakarta, Indonesia for decades. Here, we report the
      dengue epidemiology, entomology, and virology in Yogyakarta in 2016-2017, prior
      to the commencement of the Applying Wolbachia to Eliminate Dengue (AWED)
      randomized trial. Dengue epidemiological data were compiled and blood samples
      from dengue-suspected patients were tested for dengue virus (DENV). Ae. aegypti
      mosquito samples were caught from the field using BG-Sentinel traps and tested
      for the presence of DENV infection. Sequencing of the DENV E gene was used to
      determine the phylogeny and genotypes of circulating DENV. Within the last
      decade, the 2016-2017 dengue incidence was considered very high. Among the 649
      plasma samples collected between March 2016-February 2017; and 36,910 mosquito
      samples collected between December 2016-May 2017, a total of 197 and 38 samples
      were DENV-positive by qRT-PCR, respectively. All four DENV serotypes were
      detected, with DENV-3 (n = 88; 44.67%) and DENV-1 (n = 87; 44.16%) as the
      predominant serotype, followed by DENV-4 (n = 12; 6.09%) and DENV-2 (n = 10;
      5.08%). The Yogyakarta DENV-1 isolates were classified into Genotype I and IV,
      while DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 isolates were classified into the Cosmopolitan
      genotype, Genotype I, and Genotype II, respectively. Yogyakarta DENV isolates
      were closely related to Indonesian strains from neighboring Javanese cities,
      consistent with the endemic circulation of DENV on this highly populous island.
      Our study provides comprehensive baseline information on the DENV population
      genetic characteristics in Yogyakarta, which are useful as baseline data for the 
      AWED trial and the future DENV surveillance in the city in the presence of a
      Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti population.

TI  - A conserved set of mutations for stabilizing soluble envelope protein dimers from
      dengue and Zika viruses to advance the development of subunit vaccines.

AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV serotypes 1-4) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are related
      flaviviruses that continue to be a public health concern, infecting hundreds of
      millions of people annually. The traditional live-attenuated virus vaccine
      approach has been challenging for the four DENV serotypes because of the need to 
      achieve balanced replication of four independent vaccine components. Subunit
      vaccines represent an alternative approach that may circumvent problems inherent 
      with live-attenuated DENV vaccines. In mature virus particles, the envelope (E)
      protein forms a homodimer that covers the surface of the virus and is the major
      target of neutralizing antibodies. Many neutralizing antibodies bind to
      quaternary epitopes that span across both E proteins in the homodimer. For
      soluble E (sE) protein to be a viable subunit vaccine, the antigens should be
      easy to produce and retain quaternary epitopes recognized by neutralizing
      antibodies. However, WT sE proteins are primarily monomeric at conditions
      relevant for vaccination and exhibit low expression yields. Previously, we
      identified amino acid mutations that stabilize the sE homodimer from DENV2 and
      dramatically raise expression yields. Here, we tested whether these same
      mutations raise the stability of sE from other DENV serotypes and ZIKV. We show
      that the mutations raise thermostability for sE from all the viruses, increase
      production yields from 4-fold to 250-fold, stabilize the homodimer, and promote
      binding to dimer-specific neutralizing antibodies. Our findings suggest that
      these sE variants could be valuable resources in the efforts to develop effective
      subunit vaccines for DENV serotypes 1 to 4 and ZIKV.

PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.1080/09603123.2022.2076815 [doi]
AB  - Among several vector control methods commonly used, environmental management is
      one of the control measures to mitigate dengue in such vulnerable communities.
      Since there is no curative treatment for dengue yet, targeted environmental and
      ecosystem management is increasingly relevant. Hence, this review was conducted
      to identify the effectiveness of environmental management intervention strategy
      to reduce dengue cases. We searched PUBMED, CENTRAL, SCOPUS, Web of Science,
      CIJE, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to January 2021. A total of 521
      articles were screened. Only 16 studies were included in this review. There were 
      6 studies that applied all three types of environmental management interventions 
      (manipulation, modification and behavior), 8 studies applied two types of
      interventions (manipulation and behavior) and 2 studies applied one type of
      intervention (manipulation or behavior). All included studies reported reduction 
      of Aedes entomological indices. The studies showed reduction in dengue cases and 
      density of Aedes population through environmental interventions. It is
      recommended for the health authority to incorporate environmental management
      intervention in dengue control activities and enhanced the community involvement 
      to ensure sustainability with high impact on dengue reduction.

AB  - Dengue is an arboviral disease caused by the dengue flavivirus. The NS5 protein
      of flaviviruses is a potential therapeutic target, and comprises an RNA-dependent
      RNA polymerase (RDRP) domain that catalyses viral replication. The aim of this
      study was to repurpose FDA-approved drugs against the RDRP domain of dengue virus
      serotype 3 (DENV3) using structure-based virtual screening and molecular dynamics
      (MD) simulations. The FDA-approved drugs were screened against the RDRP domain of
      DENV3 using a two-step docking-based screening approach with Glide SP and Glide
      XP. For comparison, four reported DENV3 RDRP inhibitors were docked as standards.
      The hitlist was screened based on the docking score of the inhibitor with the
      lowest docking score (PubChem ID: 118797902; reported IC50 value: 0.34 microM).
      Five hits with docking scores and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface
      Area (MM-GBSA) energy lower than those of 118797902 were selected. The stability 
      of the hit-receptor complexes was investigated using 100 ns MD simulations in an 
      explicit solvent. The results of MD simulations demonstrated that polydatin and
      betiatide remained stably bound to the receptor, and formed stable interactions
      with the RDRP domain of DENV3. The hit-receptor interactions were comparable to
      those of 118797902. The average Prime MM-GBSA energy of polydatin and betiatide
      was lower than that of 118797902 during simulation, indicating that their binding
      affinity to DENV3 RDRP was higher than that of the standard. The results of this 
      study may aid in the development of serotype-selective drugs against dengue in
      the future.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

TI  - Clinical Safety Experience of TAK-003 for Dengue Fever: a new Tetravalent Live
      Attenuated Vaccine Candidate.
LID - ciac418 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac418 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An unmet medical need remains for an effective dengue tetravalent
      vaccine that can be administered irrespective of previous dengue exposure.
      TAK-003, a dengue tetravalent vaccine, has demonstrated efficacy in an ongoing
      phase 3 trial in children and adolescents living in dengue-endemic areas, with an
      acceptable safety profile in both dengue-naive and -exposed individuals. METHODS:
      Safety findings are presented herein from an integrated analysis of data for
      healthy 4-60-year-olds from two phase 2 and three phase 3 double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trials of TAK-003 (TAK-003: n = 14,627; placebo: n = 
      7,167). Safety evaluation included analyses of post-injection reactogenicity,
      unsolicited adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and deaths. Subgroup
      analyses were performed by age group, baseline serostatus, and gender. RESULTS:
      The most common local and systemic AEs were injection site pain (TAK-003: 43%;
      placebo: 26%) and headache (TAK-003: 34%; placebo: 30%). Injection site AEs were 
      mostly mild and resolved within 1-3 days. Unsolicited AEs and AEs leading to
      discontinuation occurred with similar frequency across both groups, while SAEs
      were fewer for TAK-003 recipients (6% vs 8% placebo). Four of the five
      vaccine-related SAEs (which included hypersensitivity, dengue fever, and dengue
      hemorrhagic fever) occurred in the placebo group. No deaths were considered
      vaccine-related. Subgroup analyses showed no differences in safety by baseline
      serostatus or by gender, albeit analysis by age indicated greater local
      reactogenicity rates for adolescents (TAK-003: 46%; placebo: 28%) and adults
      (TAK-003: 56%, placebo: 19%) than for children (TAK-003: 37%, placebo: 25%).
      CONCLUSION: No important safety risks were identified, and TAK-003 was
      well-tolerated irrespective of age, gender, or baseline dengue serostatus in
      recipients aged 4-60 years.

TI  - Perplexity as a provocation: revisiting the role of metaphor as a 'place holder' 
      for the potential of COVID-19 antibodies.
LID - medhum-2021-012343 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/medhum-2021-012343 [doi]
AB  - This article revisits long-standing critiques of the role of metaphor in
      immunological discourse. Drawing on Alfred North Whitehead's speculative
      philosophy of organism, I focus on the use of metaphor to explain the process by 
      which COVID-19 vaccine research is able to generate protective antibodies, the
      challenge of autoimmune disease and dengue fever antibodies. I suggest that
      metaphors are provoked by the perplexity that arises from presupposing that
      distinct morphological substances are the first order of reality. I conclude that
      rather than seeing metaphors as typically skewing conceptions of the body, as has
      been previously argued, those of memory, recognition and misrecognition may be
      instructive of a body in transition. Indeed, a process of transition that shows
      degrees of creativity. When gesturing towards the processual nature of infection 
      and immunity, metaphors invite new modes of shared thinking across the
      disciplinary divide.

TI  - Role of Lectin in the Response of Aedes aegypti Against Bt Toxin.
PG  - 898198
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.898198 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is one of the world's most dangerous mosquitoes, and a vector of
      diseases such as dengue fever, chikungunya virus, yellow fever, and Zika virus
      disease. Currently, a major global challenge is the scarcity of antiviral
      medicine and vaccine for arboviruses. Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis
      (Bti) toxins are used as biological mosquito control agents. Endotoxins,
      including Cry4Aa, Cry4Ba, Cry10Aa, Cry11Aa, and Cyt1Aa, are toxic to mosquitoes. 
      Insect eradication by Cry toxin relies primarily on the interaction of cry toxins
      with key toxin receptors, such as aminopeptidase (APN), alkaline phosphatase
      (ALP), cadherin (CAD), and ATP-binding cassette transporters. The carbohydrate
      recognition domains (CRDs) of lectins and domains II and III of Cry toxins share 
      similar structural folds, suggesting that midgut proteins, such as C-type lectins
      (CTLs), may interfere with interactions among Cry toxins and receptors by binding
      to both and alter Cry toxicity. In the present review, we summarize the
      functional role of C-type lectins in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and the mechanism
      underlying the alteration of Cry toxin activity by CTLs. Furthermore, we outline 
      future research directions on elucidating the Bti resistance mechanism. This
      study provides a basis for understanding Bti resistance, which can be used to
      develop novel insecticides.

TI  - Metagenome Sequencing Reveals the Microbiome of Aedes albopictus and Its Possible
      Relationship With Dengue Virus Susceptibility.
PG  - 891151
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.891151 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses a serious
      risk to human health. Aedes albopictus is a widely distributed vector of dengue
      fever in China. Based on the impact of physiological activity, the microbiome in 
      A. albopictus will provide a novel environment-friendly approach to control DENV 
      transmission. We performed metagenomic sequencing on A. albopictus before and
      after exposure to DENV blood meal to detect microbiome variation of A. albopictus
      with different susceptibilities to DENV. The dominant phyla in A. albopictus
      microbiome were Proteobacteria and Ascomycota, and the dominant genera were
      Aspergillus and Metarhizium. Gammaproteobacteria bacterium, Lactobacillus
      harbinensis, and Neurospora crassa differed significantly after DENV infection.
      There were 15 different microorganisms found to be involved in mosquito immunity 
      and metabolism, such as Alphaproteobacteria bacterium, Methyloglobulus morosus,
      and Shigella sonnei, which might have an impact on the DENV susceptibility of A. 
      albopictus. It was hypothesized that the lack of specific bacteria may lead to
      increased susceptibility of A. albopictus to DENV. Interventions in the
      microbiome composition or specific bacteria of A. albopictus may affect the
      susceptibility to DENV and control the mosquito-borne diseases efficiently.

TI  - Cranberry Pomace Extract Exerts Antiviral Activity against Zika and Dengue Virus 
      at Safe Doses for Adult Zebrafish.

AB  - Mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV) and zika virus (ZIKV) infections constitute a 
      global health emergency. Antivirals directly targeting the virus infectious cycle
      are still needed to prevent dengue hemorrhagic fever and congenital zika
      syndrome. In the present study, we demonstrated that Cranberry Pomace (CP)
      extract, a polyphenol-rich agrifood byproduct recovered following cranberry juice
      extraction, blocks DENV and ZIKV infection in human Huh7.5 and A549 cell lines,
      respectively, in non-cytotoxic concentrations. Our virological assays identified 
      CP extract as a potential inhibitor of virus entry into the host-cell by acting
      directly on viral particles, thus preventing their attachment to the cell
      surface. At effective antiviral doses, CP extract proved safe and tolerable in a 
      zebrafish model. In conclusion, polyphenol-rich agrifood byproducts such as berry
      extracts are a promising source of safe and naturally derived nutraceutical
      antivirals that target medically important pathogens.

TI  - Decadal Change in Seroprevalence of Chikungunya Virus Infection in Pune City,
      India.
LID - 998 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050998 [doi]
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus capable of causing large
      outbreaks. We aimed to determine the decadal change in the extent of chikungunya 
      virus infection from 2009 to 2019. We implemented a prospective cross-sectional
      survey in Pune City using a 30-cluster approach with
      probability-proportion-to-size (PPS) sampling, with blood samples collected from 
      1654 participants in early 2019. The study also included an additional 799 blood 
      samples from an earlier serosurvey in late 2009. The samples were tested by an
      in-house anti-CHIKV IgG ELISA assay. The overall seroprevalence in 2019 was 53.2%
      (95% CI 50.7-55.6) as against 8.5% (95% CI 6.5-10.4) in 2009. A fivefold increase
      in seroprevalence was observed in a decade (p &lt; 0.00001). The seroprevalence
      increased significantly with age; however, it did not differ between genders.
      Modeling of age-stratified seroprevalence data from 2019 coincided with a recent 
      outbreak in 2016 followed by the low-level circulation. The mean estimated force 
      of infection during the outbreak was 35.8% (95% CI 2.9-41.2), and it was 1.2%
      after the outbreak. To conclude, the study reports a fivefold increase in the
      seroprevalence of chikungunya infection over a decade in Pune City. The modeling 
      approach considering intermittent outbreaks with continuous low-level circulation
      was a better fit and coincided with a recent outbreak reported in 2016. Community
      engagement and effective vector control measures are needed to avert future
      chikungunya outbreaks.

TI  - Innate Immune Response to Dengue Virus: Toll-like Receptors and Antiviral
      Response.
LID - 992 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050992 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV1-4).
      The clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to life-threatening dengue
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and/or Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). Viral and host
      factors are related to the clinical outcome of dengue, although the disease
      pathogenesis remains uncertain. The innate antiviral response to DENV is
      implemented by a variety of immune cells and inflammatory mediators. Blood
      monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and tissue macrophages are the main target cells
      of DENV infection. These cells recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns
      (PAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Pathogen recognition is a
      critical step in eliciting the innate immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
      are responsible for the innate recognition of pathogens and represent an
      essential component of the innate and adaptive immune response. Ten different
      TLRs are described in humans, which are expressed in many different immune cells.
      The engagement of TLRs with viral PAMPs triggers downstream signaling pathways
      leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines, interferons (IFNs) and other
      molecules essential for the prevention of viral replication. Here, we summarize
      the crucial TLRs' roles in the antiviral innate immune response to DENV and their
      association with viral pathogenesis.

TI  - Molecular Characterization and Identification of Potential Inhibitors for 'E'
      Protein of Dengue Virus.
LID - 940 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050940 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is an arthropod-borne acute febrile illness caused by Dengue Virus (DENV),
      a member of Flaviviridae. Severity of the infection ranges from mild
      self-limiting illness to severe life-threatening hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and
      dengue shock syndrome (DSS). To date, there is no specific antiviral therapy
      established to treat the infection. The current study reports the epidemiology of
      DENV infections and potential inhibitors of DENV 'E' protein. Among the various
      serotypes, DENV-2 serotype was observed more frequently, followed by DENV-4,
      DENV-1, and DENV-3. New variants of existing genotypes were observed in DENV-1,
      2, and 4 serotypes. Predominantly, the severe form of dengue was attributable to 
      DENV-2 infections, and the incidence was more common in males and pediatric
      populations. Both the incidence and the disease severity were more common among
      the residents of non-urban environments. Due to the predominantly self-limiting
      nature of primary dengue infection and folk medicine practices of non-urban
      populations, we observed a greater number of secondary dengue cases than primary 
      dengue cases. Hemorrhagic manifestations were more in secondary dengue in
      particularly in the pediatric group. Through different computational methods,
      ligands RGBLD1, RGBLD2, RGBLD3, and RGBLD4 are proposed as potential inhibitors
      in silico against DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 serotypes.

TI  - Acute-phase Serum Cytokine Levels and Correlation with Clinical Outcomes in
      Children and Adults with Primary and Secondary Dengue Virus Infection in Myanmar 
      between 2017 and 2019.
LID - 558 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11050558 [doi]
AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) has been endemic in Myanmar since 1970, causing outbreaks
      every 2-3 years. DENV infection symptoms range from mild fever to lethal
      hemorrhage. Clinical biomarkers must be identified to facilitate patient risk
      stratification in the early stages of infection. We analyzed 45 cytokines and
      other factors in serum samples from the acute phase of DENV infection (within 3-5
      days of symptom onset) from 167 patients in Yangon, Myanmar, between 2017 and
      2019. All of the patients tested positive for serum DENV nonstructural protein 1 
      antigen (NS1 Ag); 78.4% and 62.9% were positive for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G 
      (IgG), respectively; and 18.0%, 19.8%, and 11.9% tested positive for serotypes 1,
      3, and 4, respectively. Although the DENV-4 viral load was significantly higher
      than those of DENV-1 or DENV-3, disease severity was not associated with viral
      load or serotype. Significant correlations were identified between disease
      severity and CCL5, SCF, PDGF-BB, IL-10, and TNF-alpha levels; between NS1 Ag and 
      SCF, CCL5, IFN-alpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-22 levels; between thrombocytopenia and
      IL-2, TNF-alpha, VEGF-D, and IL-6 levels; and between primary or secondary
      infection and IL-2, IL-6, IL-31, IL-12p70, and MIP-1beta levels. These
      circulating factors may represent leading signatures in acute DENV infections,
      reflecting the clinical outcomes in the dengue endemic region, Myanmar.

TI  - Transient Introgression of Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti Populations Does Not
      Elicit an Antibody Response to Wolbachia Surface Protein in Community Members.
LID - 535 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11050535 [doi]
AB  - Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium that can restrict the transmission of
      human pathogenic viruses by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Recent field trials have
      shown that dengue incidence is significantly reduced when Wolbachia is
      introgressed into the local Ae. aegypti population. Female Ae. aegypti are
      anautogenous and feed on human blood to produce viable eggs. Herein, we tested
      whether people who reside on Tri Nguyen Island (TNI), Vietnam developed
      antibodies to Wolbachia Surface Protein (WSP) following release of
      Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti, as a measure of exposure to Wolbachia. Paired
      blood samples were collected from 105 participants before and after mosquito
      releases and anti-WSP titres were measured by ELISA. We determined no change in
      anti-WSP titres after ~30 weeks of high levels of Wolbachia-Ae. aegypti on TNI.
      These data suggest that humans are not exposed to the major Wolbachia surface
      antigen, WSP, following introgression of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti
      mosquitoes.

TI  - Subsets of Cytokines and Chemokines from DENV-4-Infected Patients Could Regulate 
      the Endothelial Integrity of Cultured Microvascular Endothelial Cells.
LID - 509 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11050509 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: It is a consensus that inflammatory mediators produced by immune
      cells contribute to changes in endothelial permeability in dengue. We propose to 
      relate inflammatory mediators seen in dengue patients with the in vitro
      alteration of endothelial cells (ECs) cultured with serum from these patients.
      Methods: Patients with mild (DF) to moderate and severe dengue (DFWS/Sev) were
      selected. ELISA quantified inflammatory mediators. Expression of adhesion
      molecules and CD147 were evaluated in the ECs cultured with the patient's serum
      by flow cytometry. We assessed endothelial permeability by measuring
      transendothelial electrical resistance in cocultures of ECs with patient serum.
      Results: Dengue infection led to an increase in inflammatory mediators-the IL-10 
      distinguished DF from DFWS/Sev. There were no changes in CD31, CD54, and CD106
      but decreased CD147 expression in ECs. DFWS/Sev sera induced a greater difference
      in endothelial permeability than DF sera. Correlation statistical test indicated 
      that low IL-10 and IFN-gamma and high CCL5 maintain the integrity of ECs in DF
      patients. In contrast, increased TNF, IFN-gamma, CXCL8, and CCL2 maintain EC
      integrity in DFWS/Sev patients. Conclusions: Our preliminary data suggest that a 
      subset of inflammatory mediators may be related to the maintenance or loss of
      endothelial integrity, reflecting the clinical prognosis.

TI  - Hit-to-Lead Short Peptides against Dengue Type 2 Envelope Protein: Computational 
      and Experimental Investigations.
LID - 3233 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27103233 [doi]
AB  - Data from the World Health Organisation show that the global incidence of dengue 
      infection has risen drastically, with an estimated 400 million cases of dengue
      infection occurring annually. Despite this worrying trend, there is still no
      therapeutic treatment available. Herein, we investigated short peptide fragments 
      with a varying total number of amino acid residues (peptide fragments) from
      previously reported dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) peptide-based inhibitors, DN58wt 
      (GDSYIIIGVEPGQLKENWFKKGSSIGQMF), DN58opt (TWWCFYFCRRHHPFWFFYRHN), DS36wt
      (LITVNPIVTEKDSPVNIEAE), and DS36opt (RHWEQFYFRRRERKFWLFFW), aided by in silico
      approaches: peptide-protein molecular docking and 100 ns of molecular dynamics
      (MD) simulation via molecular mechanics using Poisson-Boltzmann surface area
      (MMPBSA) and molecular mechanics generalised Born surface area (MMGBSA) methods. 
      A library of 11,699 peptide fragments was generated, subjected to in silico
      calculation, and the candidates with the excellent binding affinity and shown to 
      be stable in the DI-DIII binding pocket of DENV2 envelope (E) protein were
      determined. Selected peptides were synthesised using conventional Fmoc
      solid-phase peptide chemistry, purified by RP-HPLC, and characterised using LCMS.
      In vitro studies followed, to test for the peptides' toxicity and efficacy in
      inhibiting the DENV2 growth cycle. Our studies identified the electrostatic
      interaction (from free energy calculation) to be the driving stabilising force
      for the E protein-peptide interactions. Five key E protein residues were also
      identified that had the most interactions with the peptides: (polar) LYS36,
      ASN37, and ARG350, and (nonpolar) LEU351 and VAL354; these residues might play
      crucial roles in the effective binding interactions. One of the peptide
      fragments, DN58opt_8-13 (PFWFFYRH), showed the best inhibitory activity, at about
      63% DENV2 plague reduction, compared with no treatment. This correlates well with
      the in silico studies in which the peptide possessed the lowest binding energy
      (-9.0 kcal/mol) and was maintained steadily within the binding pocket of DENV2 E 
      protein during the MD simulations. This study demonstrates the use of
      computational studies to expand research on lead optimisation of antiviral
      peptides, thus explaining the inhibitory potential of the designed peptides.

      Replication.
LID - 3217 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27103217 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is an important arboviral infectious disease for which there is currently 
      no specific cure. We report gemini-like (geminoid) alkylated amphiphilic peptides
      containing lysines in combination with glycines or alanines (C15H31C(O)-Lys-(Gly 
      or Ala)nLys-NHC16H33, shorthand notation C16-KXnK-C16 with X = A or G, and n =
      0-2). The representatives with 1 or 2 Ala inhibit dengue protease and human
      furin, two serine proteases involved in dengue virus infection that have peptides
      with cationic amino acids as their preferred substrates, with IC50 values in the 
      lower microM range. The geminoid C16-KAK-C16 combined inhibition of DENV2
      protease (IC50 2.3 microM) with efficacy against replication of wildtype DENV2 in
      LLC-MK2 cells (EC50 4.1 microM) and an absence of toxicity. We conclude that the 
      lysine-based geminoids have activity against dengue virus infection, which is
      based on their inhibition of the proteases involved in viral replication and are 
      therefore promising leads to further developing antiviral therapeutics, not
      limited to dengue.

TI  - Investigation and Biological Assessment of Rumex vesicarius L. Extract:
      Characterization of the Chemical Components and Antioxidant, Antimicrobial,
      Cytotoxic, and Anti-Dengue Vector Activity.
LID - 3177 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27103177 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the biological potency and chemical
      composition of Rumex vesicarius aboveground parts using GC-MS. In this approach, 
      44 components were investigated, comprising 99.99% of the total volatile
      compounds. The major components were classified as fatty acids and lipids
      (51.36%), oxygenated hydrocarbons (33.59%), amines (7.35%), carbohydrates
      (6.06%), steroids (1.21%), and alkaloids (0.42%). The major components were
      interpreted as 1,3-dihydroxypropan-2-yl oleate (oxygenated hydrocarbons, 18.96%),
      ethyl 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1-carboxylate (ester of fatty acid, 17.56%), and
      2-propyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ol (oxygenated hydrocarbons, 11.18%). The DPPH
      antioxidant activity of the extracted components of R. vesicarius verified that
      the shoot extract was the most potent with IC50 = 28.89 mg/L, with the
      percentages of radical scavenging activity at 74.28% +/- 3.51%. The extracted
      plant, on the other hand, showed substantial antibacterial activity against the
      diverse bacterial species, namely, Salmonella typhi (23.46 +/- 1.69), Bacillus
      cereus (22.91 +/- 0.96), E. coli (21.07 +/- 0.80), and Staphylococcus aureus
      (17.83 +/- 0.67). In addition, the extracted plant was in vitro assessed as a
      considerable anticancer agent on HepG2 cells, in which MTT, cell proliferation
      cycle, and DNA fragmentation assessments were applied on culture and treated
      cells. The larvicidal efficacy of the extracted plant was also evaluated against 
      Aedes aegypti, the dengue disease vector. As a result, we may infer that R.
      vesicarius extract increased cytocompatibility and cell migratory capabilities,
      and that it may be effective in mosquito control without causing harm.

TI  - Enhanced Immunogenicity of Inactivated Dengue Vaccines by Novel
      Polysaccharide-Based Adjuvants in Mice.
LID - 1034 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10051034 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever, caused by any of four dengue viruses (DENV1-4), is a major global
      burden. Currently, there is no effective vaccine that prevents infection in
      dengue naive populations. We tested the ability of two novel adjuvants (Advax-PEI
      and Advax-2), using aluminum hydroxide (alum) as control, to enhance the
      immunogenicity of formalin- or psoralen-inactivated (PIV or PsIV) DENV2 vaccines 
      in mice. Mice were vaccinated on days 0 and 30, and serum samples were collected 
      on days 30, 60, 90, and 101. Neutralizing antibodies were determined by
      microneutralization (MN) assays, and the geometric mean 50% MN (MN50) titers were
      calculated. For the PIV groups, after one dose MN50 titers were higher in the
      novel adjuvant groups compared to the alum control, while MN50 titers were
      comparable between the adjuvant groups after the second dose. For the PsIV
      groups, both novel adjuvants induced higher MN50 titers than the alum control
      after the second dose. Spleen cells were collected on days 45 and 101 for
      enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) for IFNgamma and IL4. Both PIV and PsIV groups
      elicited different degrees of IFNgamma and IL4 responses. Overall, Advax-2 gave
      the best responses just ahead of Advax-PEI. Given Advax-2's extensive human
      experience in other vaccine applications, it will be pursued for further
      development.

TI  - Stimuli Followed by Avian Malaria Vectors in Host-Seeking Behaviour.
LID - 726 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biology11050726 [doi]
AB  - Vector-borne infectious diseases (e.g., malaria, dengue fever, and yellow fever) 
      result from a parasite transmitted to humans and other animals by blood-feeding
      arthropods. They are major contributors to the global disease burden, as they
      account for nearly a fifth of all infectious diseases worldwide. The interaction 
      between vectors and their hosts plays a key role driving vector-borne disease
      transmission. Therefore, identifying factors governing host selection by
      blood-feeding insects is essential to understand the transmission dynamics of
      vector-borne diseases. Here, we review published information on the physical and 
      chemical stimuli (acoustic, visual, olfactory, moisture and thermal cues) used by
      mosquitoes and other haemosporidian vectors to detect their vertebrate hosts. We 
      mainly focus on studies on avian malaria and related haemosporidian parasites
      since this animal model has historically provided important advances in our
      understanding on ecological and evolutionary process ruling vector-borne disease 
      dynamics and transmission. We also present relevant studies analysing the
      capacity of feather and skin symbiotic bacteria in the production of volatile
      compounds with vector attractant properties. Furthermore, we review the role of
      uropygial secretions and symbiotic bacteria in bird-insect vector interactions.
      In addition, we present investigations examining the alterations induced by
      haemosporidian parasites on their arthropod vector and vertebrate host to enhance
      parasite transmission. Finally, we propose future lines of research for designing
      successful vector control strategies and for infectious disease management.

TI  - Rapid Detection of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies with a Screen-Printed Electrode
      Modified with a Spike Glycoprotein Epitope.
LID - 272 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12050272 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by an infection 
      with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was
      recognized in late 2019 and has since spread worldwide, leading to a pandemic
      with unprecedented health and financial consequences. There remains an enormous
      demand for new diagnostic methods that can deliver fast, low-cost, and
      easy-to-use confirmation of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have developed an
      affordable electrochemical biosensor for the rapid detection of serological
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody in sera against the spike protein. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A previously identified linear B-cell epitope (EP) specific to the
      SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and recognized by IgG in patient sera was selected 
      for the target molecule. After synthesis, the EP was immobilized onto the surface
      of the working electrode of a commercially available screen-printed electrode
      (SPE). The capture of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgGs allowed the formation of an
      immunocomplex that was measured by square-wave voltammetry from its generation of
      hydroquinone (HQ). RESULTS: An evaluation of the performance of the EP-based
      biosensor presented a selectivity and specificity for COVID-19 of 93% and 100%,
      respectively. No cross-reaction was observed to antibodies against other diseases
      that included Chagas disease, Chikungunya, Leishmaniosis, and Dengue.
      Differentiation of infected and non-infected individuals was possible even at a
      high dilution factor that decreased the required sample volumes to a few
      microliters. CONCLUSION: The final device proved suitable for diagnosing COVID-19
      by assaying actual serum samples, and the results displayed good agreement with
      the molecular biology diagnoses. The flexibility to conjugate other EPs to SPEs
      suggests that this technology could be rapidly adapted to diagnose new variants
      of SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens.

AB  - Vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever etc pose
      significant burden among the infectious diseases globally, especially in tropical
      and sub-tropical regions. Globalization, deforestation, urbanization, climate
      change, uncontrolled population growth, inadequate waste management and poor
      vector-management infrastructure have all contributed to the expansion of vector 
      habitats and subsequent increase in vector-borne diseases throughout the world.
      Conventional vector control methods, such as use of insecticides, have
      significant negative environmental repercussions in addition to developing
      resistance in vectors. Till date, a very few vaccines or antiviral therapies have
      been approved for the treatment of vector borne diseases. In this review, we have
      discussed emerging molecular approaches like CRISPR (clustered regularly
      interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas-9, sterile insect technique (SIT),
      release of insects carrying a dominant lethal (RIDL), Wolbachia (virus
      transmission blocking) and RNA interference (RNAi) to combat vector and
      vector-borne viruses. Due to the extensive advancements in RNAi research, a
      special focus has been given on its types, biogenesis, mechanism of action,
      delivery and experimental studies evaluating their application as anti-mosquito
      and anti-viral agent. These technologies appear to be highly promising in terms
      of contributing to vector control and antiviral drug development, and hence can
      be used to reduce global vector and vector-borne disease burden.

TI  - Rickettsial Infections Are Neglected Causes of Acute Febrile Illness in Teluk
      Intan, Peninsular Malaysia.
LID - 77 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/tropicalmed7050077 [doi]
AB  - Rickettsial infections are among the leading etiologies of acute febrile illness 
      in Southeast Asia. However, recent data from Malaysia are limited. This
      prospective study was conducted in Teluk Intan, Peninsular Malaysia, during
      January to December 2016. We recruited 309 hospitalized adult patients with acute
      febrile illness. Clinical and biochemistry data were obtained, and patients were 
      stratified into mild and severe infections based on the sepsis-related organ
      failure (qSOFA) scoring system. Diagnostic assays including blood cultures,
      real-time PCR, and serology (IFA and MAT) were performed. In this study,
      pathogens were identified in 214 (69%) patients, of which 199 (93%) patients had 
      a single etiology, and 15 (5%) patients had &gt;1 etiologies. The top three
      causes of febrile illness requiring hospitalization in this Malaysian study were 
      leptospirosis (68 (32%)), dengue (58 (27%)), and rickettsioses (42 (19%)).
      Fifty-five (18%) patients presented with severe disease with a qSOFA score of
      >/=2. Mortality was documented in 38 (12%) patients, with the highest seen in
      leptospirosis (16 (42%)) followed by rickettsiosis (4 (11%)). While the
      significance of leptospirosis and dengue are recognized, the impact of
      rickettsial infections in Peninsular Malaysia remains under appreciated.
      Management guidelines for in-patient care with acute febrile illness in
      Peninsular Malaysia are needed.

TI  - Dengue and COVID-19: Managing Undifferentiated Febrile Illness during a
      "Twindemic".
LID - 68 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/tropicalmed7050068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, distinguishing dengue from COVID-19 in 
      endemic areas can be difficult, as both may present as undifferentiated febrile
      illness. COVID-19 cases may also present with false-positive dengue serology.
      Hospitalisation protocols for managing undifferentiated febrile illness are
      essential in mitigating the risk from both COVID-19 and dengue. METHODS: At a
      tertiary hospital contending with COVID-19 during a dengue epidemic, a triage
      strategy of routine COVID-19 testing for febrile patients with viral prodromes
      was used. All febrile patients with viral prodromes and no epidemiologic risk for
      COVID-19 were first admitted to a designated ward for COVID-19 testing, from
      January 2020 to December 2021. RESULTS: A total of 6103 cases of COVID-19 and
      1251 cases of dengue were managed at our institution, comprising a total of 3.9% 
      (6103/155,452) and 0.8% (1251/155,452) of admissions, respectively. A surge in
      dengue hospitalisations in mid-2020 corresponded closely with the imposition of a
      community-wide lockdown. A total of 23 cases of PCR-proven COVID-19 infection
      with positive dengue serology were identified, of whom only two were true
      co-infections; both had been appropriately isolated upon admission. Average
      length-of-stay for dengue cases initially admitted to isolation during the
      pandemic was 8.35 days (S.D. = 6.53), compared with 6.91 days (S.D. = 8.61) for
      cases admitted outside isolation (1.44 days, 95%CI = 0.58-2.30, p = 0.001).
      Pre-pandemic, only 1.6% (9/580) of dengue cases were admitted initially to
      isolation-areas; in contrast, during the pandemic period, 66.6% (833/1251) of
      dengue cases were initially admitted to isolation-areas while awaiting the
      results of SARS-CoV-2 testing. CONCLUSIONS: During successive COVID-19 pandemic
      waves in a dengue-endemic country, coinfection with dengue and COVID-19 was
      uncommon. Routine COVID-19 testing for febrile patients with viral prodromes
      mitigated the potential infection-prevention risk from COVID-19 cases, albeit
      with an increased length-of-stay for dengue hospitalizations admitted initially
      to isolation.

AB  - Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne-disease of growing public health importance in
      Africa. The continuous increase of number and frequency of outbreaks of dengue
      fever, especially in urban area in Africa underline the need to review the
      current data available on vectors involved in dengue virus transmission in
      Africa. Here, we summarized the available data on vectors involved in the
      transmission of dengue virus in the sylvatic and urban environments, vertical
      transmission, vector competence studies, and vector control strategies used in
      Africa. The virus was isolated mainly from Aedes furcifer, Ae. luteocephalus, and
      Ae. taylori in the sylvatic environment and from Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus
      in the urban areas. Prospective and urgently needed studies on vectors biology,
      behavior, and alternative control strategies are suggested.

      pathophysiology.
PG  - 104384
LID - 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104384 [doi]
AB  - Monocytes are known to play a critical role in dengue pathophysiology. However,
      which monocyte subset expresses what inflammatory mediator(s) and what
      transcriptional features distinguish each of the monocyte subset in vivo remain
      poorly understood. In this study we provide a detailed transcriptional analysis
      of the three human monocyte subsets in healthy children and in children with
      dengue febrile illness. Notably, we found that the CD14(+) CD16high intermediate 
      monocyte subset from dengue patients highly upregulated key genes involved in
      mediating inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, vascular permeability, tissue
      extravasation, and clot prevention compared to healthy children. The
      CD14(+)CD16low classical monocytes shared some of these features. These two
      subsets increased massively in patients with severe dengue. By contrast, the
      CD14(-)CD16high nonclassical monocyte subset upregulated key genes involved in
      vasoconstriction, endothelial barrier stability, and are involved in endothelial 
      patrolling while showing a significant decline from circulation. These findings
      improve our understanding of monocyte responses in dengue.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The function of traditional herbs in tropical illness therapy is
      interesting. Many researches are currently being conducted on the effects of
      traditional herbs on a number of tropical ailments, including dengue fever.
      METHODS: In this short paper, we used network pharmacology to determine a shared 
      biological pathway for the pharmacological impact of ginseng, a traditional Asian
      herb, and the pathophysiological process of dengue fever, a serious tropical
      vector-borne disease. RESULTS: Using interrelationship analysis, the authors were
      able to discover the common pathway via the vimentin node. CONCLUSION: It's
      possible that ginseng could help in dengue fever therapy.

AB  - Dengue fever is a disease with a high mortality rate around the world, which is
      an important issue for the health authorities of many countries. As a result of
      this, the search for new drugs that are effective to combat this disease has
      become necessary. Medicinal plants have been used since ancient times to treat a 
      wide list of diseases, including dengue fever. In this minireview, 12 medicinal
      plants with known pharmacological properties are presented, which have been used 
      in studies to evaluate their antiviral activity in vitro tests. Among the
      chemical agents involved in the antiviral response, found in the alcoholic
      extracts of these plants, are flavonoids, terpenes and alkaloids, which within
      the mechanism of action in blocking viral replication are considered entry
      inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, translation inhibitors and protease inhibitors.
      The present work shows whether these plants possess antiviral activity and the
      chemical compounds involved in this response.

AB  - The antiviral defense directed by the RNAi pathway employs distinct specificity
      and effector mechanisms compared with other immune responses. The specificity of 
      antiviral RNAi is programmed by siRNAs processed from virus-derived
      double-stranded RNA by Dicer endonuclease. Argonaute-containing RNA-induced
      silencing complex loaded with the viral siRNAs acts as the effector to mediate
      specific virus clearance by RNAi. Recent studies have provided evidence for the
      production and antiviral function of virus-derived siRNAs in both
      undifferentiated and differentiated mammalian cells infected with a range of RNA 
      viruses when the cognate virus-encoded suppressor of RNAi (VSR) is rendered
      nonfunctional. In this review, we discuss the function, mechanism, and
      evolutionary origin of the validated mammalian VSRs and cell culture assays for
      their identification.

TI  - Cross-reactive antibodies targeting surface-exposed non-structural protein 1
      (NS1) of dengue virus-infected cells recognize epitopes on the spaghetti loop of 
      the beta-ladder domain.
PG  - e0266136
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0266136 [doi]
AB  - Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a glycoprotein component of dengue virus (DENV)
      that is essential for viral replication, infection and immune evasion.
      Immunization with NS1 has been shown to elicit antibody-mediated immune responses
      which protect mice against DENV infections. Here, we obtained peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells from human subjects with secondary dengue infections, which
      were used to construct a dengue immune phage library displaying single-chain
      variable fragments. Phage selective for DENV NS1 were obtained by biopanning.
      Twenty-one monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against DENV NS1 were generated from the 
      selected phage and characterized in detail. We found most anti-NS1 mAbs used
      IGHV1 heavy chain antibody genes. The mAbs were classified into strongly and
      weakly-reactive groups based on their binding to NS1 expressed in dengue virus 2 
      (DENV2)-infected cells. Antibody binding experiments with recombinant NS1
      proteins revealed that the mAbs recognize conformational epitopes on the
      beta-ladder domain (amino acid residues 178-273) of DENV NS1. Epitope mapping
      studies on alanine-substituted NS1 proteins identified distinct but overlapping
      epitopes. Protruding amino acids distributed around the spaghetti loop are
      required for the binding of the strongly-reactive mAbs, whereas the recognition
      residues of the weakly-reactive mAbs are likely to be located in inaccessible
      sites facing toward the cell membrane. This information could guide the design of
      an NS1 epitope-based vaccine that targets cross-reactive conserved epitopes on
      cell surface-associated DENV NS1.

      Without Causing Antibody-Dependent Enhancement.

AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic poses a substantial threat to the public, and the 
      development of safe and effective vaccines is a demanding challenge. In this
      study, we constructed a kind of self-assembling nanovaccine which confers
      complete protection against ZIKV infection. The ZIKV envelop protein domain III
      (zEDIII) was presented on recombinant human heavy chain ferritin (rHF) to form
      the zEDIII-rHF nanoparticle. Immunization of mice with zEDIII-rHF nanoparticle in
      the absence of an adjuvant induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses. 
      zEDIII-rHF vaccination conferred complete protection against lethal infection
      with ZIKV and eliminated pathological symptoms in the brain. Importantly, the
      zEDIII-rHF nanovaccine induced immune response did not cross-react with dengue
      virus-2, overcoming the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) problem that is a
      safety concern for ZIKV vaccine development. Our constructed zEDIII-rHF
      nanovaccine, with superior protective performance and avoidance of ADE, provides 
      an effective and safe vaccine candidate against ZIKV.

TI  - GC-MS Profile, Antioxidant Activity, and In Silico Study of the Essential Oil
      from Schinus molle L. Leaves in the Presence of Mosquito Juvenile Hormone-Binding
      Protein (mJHBP) from Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 5601531

AB  - Schinus molle is a medicinal plant used as an anti-inflammatory and for rheumatic
      pain in the traditional medicine of Peru. On the other hand, Aedes aegypti is the
      main vector of several tropical diseases and the transmitter of yellow fever,
      chikungunya, malaria, dengue, and Zika virus. In this study, the aim was to
      investigate the antioxidant activity in vitro and the insecticidal activity in
      silico, in the presence of the mosquito juvenile hormone-binding protein (mJHBP) 
      from Aedes aegypti, of the essential oil from S. molle leaves. The volatile
      phytochemicals were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and
      the profile antioxidants were examined by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays. The
      evaluation in silico was carried out on mJHBP (PDB: 5V13) with an insecticidal
      approach. The results revealed that EO presented as the main volatile components 
      to alpha-phellandrene (32.68%), D-limonene (12.59%), and beta-phellandrene
      (12.24%). The antioxidant activity showed values for DPPH = 11.42 +/- 0.08 mumol 
      ET/g, ABTS = 134.88 +/- 4.37 mumol ET/g, and FRAP = 65.16 +/- 1.46 mumol ET/g.
      Regarding the insecticidal approach in silico, alpha-muurolene and gamma-cadinene
      had the best biding energy on mJHBP (DeltaG = -9.7 kcal/mol), followed by
      beta-cadinene (DeltaG = -9.5 kcal/mol). Additionally, the volatile components did
      not reveal antioxidant activity, and its potential insecticidal effect would be
      acting on mJHBP from A. aegypti.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the maternal and peri-natal outcomes of dengue
      infection and frequency of dengue immunoglobulin G positivity in pregnant women
      along with pregnancy outcomes. Method: The observational two-phase study was
      conducted from 2012 to 2015 in Lahore, Pakistan. In phase 1, pregnant women who
      had acute dengue fever were prospectively and retrospectively enrolled from 4
      tertiary care hospitals. Demographic data, clinical/laboratory parameters and
      maternal/foetal outcomes were recorded for each subject. In the second phase,
      normal pregnant women with no current or past history of dengue fever were
      enrolled from Gynaecology Department of Shaikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, to
      determine the frequency of dengue immunoglobulin G positivity and pregnancy
      outcome. Data was analysed using SPSS 20. RESULTS: Of the 12 subjects in phase 1,
      10(83.3%) were prospective cases and 2(16.6%) were retrospective. The overall
      mean age was 26.3+/-5.4 years, 7(58.3%) were in 2nd and 5(41.6%) were in 3rd
      trimester of pregnancy. Among the 4(33.3%) women at gestational age >/=33 weeks, 
      3(75%) had poor foetal outcome. In the second phase, there were 127 women with a 
      mean age of 27.4+/-4.3 years. Among them, 38(29.9%) women were in the 2nd and
      89(70.1%) were in the 3rd trimester. Dengue immunoglobulin G positivity was found
      in 65(51.2%) cases, but poor maternal or foetal outcome was not found in such
      women. CONCLUSIONS: Acute dengue fever at late term resulted in adverse foetal
      outcomes. Frequency of dengue immunoglobulin G positivity was high among pregnant
      women, but it was not associated with adverse outcomes.

TI  - A prospective observational study of community-acquired bacterial bloodstream
      infections in Metro Manila, the Philippines.
PG  - e0010414
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010414 [doi]
AB  - Community-acquired bacterial bloodstream infections are caused by diverse
      pathogens with changing antimicrobial-resistance patterns. In low-middle income
      countries in Southeast Asia, where dengue fever is endemic and a leading cause of
      fever, limited information is available about bacterial bloodstream infections
      due to challenges of implementing a blood culture service. This study describes
      bacterial bloodstream pathogens and antimicrobial-resistance patterns in Metro
      Manila, the Philippines. We aimed to identify the proportion of patients with a
      positive blood culture, the bacteria isolated and their antimicrobial resistance 
      patterns, and the clinical characteristics of these patients, in this dengue
      endemic area. We conducted a prospective observational study in a single hospital
      enrolling febrile patients clinically suspected of having a community-acquired
      bacterial bloodstream infection between 1st July 2015 and 30th June 2019. Each
      patient had a blood culture and additional diagnostic tests according to their
      clinical presentation. We enrolled 1315 patients and a significant positive blood
      culture was found in 77 (5.9%) including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 20),
      Salmonella enterica Typhi (n = 18), Escherichia coli (n = 16), Streptococcus
      pneumoniae (n = 3) and Burkholderia pseudomallei (n = 2). Thirty-four patients
      had meningococcal disease diagnosed by culture (n = 8) or blood PCR (n = 26).
      Additional confirmed diagnoses included leptospirosis (n = 177), dengue virus
      infection (n = 159) and respiratory diphtheria (n = 50). There were 79 (6.0%,
      95%CI 4.8%-7.4%) patients who died within 28 days of enrollment. Patients with a 
      positive blood culture were significantly more likely to die than patients with
      negative culture (15.2% vs 4.4%, P<0.01). Among S. aureus isolates, 11/20 (55%)
      were methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and ST30: USA1100 was dominant sequence type
      (88.9%). Antimicrobial-susceptibility was well preserved in S. enterica Typhi.
      Among hospitalized patients with clinically suspected community-acquired
      bacterial bloodstream infection in Metro Manila, the Philippines, 5.9% had a
      blood culture confirmed infection of whom 15.6% died. S. aureus, including a
      significant number of MRSA (USA1100 clones), S. enterica Typhi, E.coli and
      Neisseria meningitidis were frequently identified pathogens.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dengue is one of the most important viral diseases globally and a
      majority of symptomatic infections result in a benign course. However, a small
      number of patients develop severe manifestations, including the cardiovascular
      (CV) manifestations, including myocardial impairment, arrhythmias, and fulminant 
      myocarditis. AREAS COVERED: Electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched for articles incorporating CV
      manifestations of dengue fever (DF). EXPERT OPINION: Included studies involved
      6,773 patients, and 3,122 (46.1%) exhibited at least one cardiac manifestation.
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (30.6%) included sinus bradycardia (8.8%), 
      nonspecific ST-T changes (8.6%), ST depression (7.9%), and T-wave inversion
      (2.3%). Mechanical sequelae were present in 10.4%, including left ventricular
      (LV) systolic dysfunction (5.7%), and myocarditis (2.9%). Pericardial involvement
      was noted as pericarditis (0.1%), pericardial effusion (1.3%), and pericardial
      tamponade (0.1%). Apart from that, the cardiac injury was depicted through a rise
      in cardiac enzymes (4.5%). The spectrum of CV manifestations in dengue is broad, 
      ranging from subtle ST-T changes to fulminant myocarditis and the use of
      contemporary techniques in diagnosing cardiac involvement should be employed for 
      rapid diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Antiviral Activity of Rosmarinic Acid Against Four Serotypes of Dengue Virus.
PG  - 203
LID - 10.1007/s00284-022-02889-3 [doi]
AB  - The present study was undertaken to evaluate the putative antiviral activity of
      Rosmarinic acid (RA) against four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). Our previous 
      in silico binding analysis revealed that RA binds strongly to the envelope domain
      III (EDIII) protein of all four DENV serotypes. We employed an in vitro Biolayer 
      Interferometry-based OCTET platform to study the binding interaction of RA with
      EDIII protein of the four DENV serotypes. Additionally, a functional plaque assay
      was developed to investigate the potential inhibition of infection of the four
      DENV serotypes. Using OCTET, the binding interaction of RA to DENV-EDIII protein 
      of the four DENV serotypes demonstrates interaction which can be arranged in the 
      following order: EDIII-DENV1 (Koff value of 1.05 s(-1)) > EDIII-DENV2 (Koff value
      of 5.63 x 10(-01) s(-1)) > EDIII-DENV3 (Koff value of 4.63 x 10(-02) s(-1)) >
      EDIII-DENV4 (Koff value of 3.53 x 10(-02) s(-1)). Subsequently, the inhibiting
      ability of RA using plaque assay confirmed reduction in the number of plaques for
      all four serotypes, indicating the ability of RA not only to bind, but also to
      inhibit the infection of four serotypes in cell culture, while being non-toxic at
      the concentrations used in the study. However, the effect of RA was variable on
      different serotypes, demonstrating highest effect on DENV1 (EC50 = 13.73
      microg/mL, SI >/= 728) followed by DENV2 (EC50 = 77.74 microg/mL, SI >/= 129),
      DENV3 (EC50 = 244 microg/mL, SI >/= 41) and DENV4 (EC50 = 280 microg/mL, SI >/=
      36).

AB  - After the latest dengue and Zika outbreaks, the fight against mosquito vectors
      has become an emerging area of research. One tool for this combat is repellents; 
      however, these products are composed of different toxic agents. Botanical
      compounds with repellent potential are an alternative; however these compounds
      are highly volatile. Thus, the present study aimed to synthesize zein-based
      polymeric nanoparticles as an efficient carrier system for the sustained release 
      of the repellents icaridin and geraniol and evaluate the toxicity of these
      nanorepellents comparing two different cell models. In vitro tests were carried
      out due to current Brazilian legislation prohibiting animal testing for cosmetics
      (current classification of repellents). The cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the 
      nanoparticles were evaluated in 2D and co-culture cell models (A549/lung
      epithelium, HaCaT/keratinocytes, HT-29/intestinal epithelium, and
      THP-1/peripheral blood monocytes). Cell viability by mitochondrial activity, cell
      membrane integrity, damage to genetic material, and expression of genes involved 
      in the allergic/inflammatory system were evaluated. The results of cytotoxicity
      evaluation showed cell viability above 70% in both cell models. No differences
      were observed in genotoxicity assessment between cells exposed to nanorepellents 
      and controls. In contrast, gene expression analysis showed increased cytokine
      expression for the emulsion compounds in 2D cell cultures compared to
      co-cultures. These findings open perspectives that zein-based nanorepellents have
      potential applications due to the reduced toxicity observed when the compounds
      are encapsulated and emerge as an alternative for arbovirus control. In addition,
      the study demonstrated that depending on the analysis, different results might be
      observed when comparing 2D and co-culture cell models to evaluate the toxicity of
      new nanosystems.

      epitopes shared with endemic coronaviruses.
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.156372 [doi]
LID - e156372 [pii]
AB  - The role of immune responses to previously seen endemic coronavirus epitopes in
      severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and disease
      progression has not yet been determined. Here, we show that a key characteristic 
      of fatal outcomes with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is that the immune
      response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is enriched for antibodies directed
      against epitopes shared with endemic beta-coronaviruses and has a lower
      proportion of antibodies targeting the more protective variable regions of the
      spike. The magnitude of antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike
      protein, its domains and subunits, and the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid also
      correlated strongly with responses to the endemic beta-coronavirus spike proteins
      in individuals admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with fatal COVID-19
      outcomes, but not in individuals with nonfatal outcomes. This correlation was
      found to be due to the antibody response directed at the S2 subunit of the
      SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which has the highest degree of conservation between
      the beta-coronavirus spike proteins. Intriguingly, antibody responses to the less
      cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid were not significantly different in
      individuals who were admitted to an ICU with fatal and nonfatal outcomes,
      suggesting an antibody profile in individuals with fatal outcomes consistent with
      an "original antigenic sin" type response.

AB  - Dengue is one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne diseases in the world,
      affecting an estimated 390 million people each year, according to models. For the
      last two decades, efforts to develop safe and effective vaccines to prevent
      dengue virus (DENV) infections have faced several challenges, mostly related to
      the complexity of conducting long-term studies to evaluate vaccine efficacy and
      safety to rule out the risk of vaccine-induced DHS/DSS, particularly in children.
      At least seven DENV vaccines have undergone different phases of clinical trials; 
      however, only three of them (Dengvaxia((R)), TV003, and TAK-003) have showed
      promising results, and are addressed in detail in this review in terms of their
      molecular design, efficacy, and immunogenicity. Safety-related challenges during 
      DENV vaccine development are also discussed.

LID - 10.3201/eid2806.212491 [doi]
AB  - Knowledge of contemporary genetic composition of dengue virus (DENV) in Africa is
      lacking. By using next-generation sequencing of samples from the 2017 DENV
      outbreak in Burkina Faso, we isolated 29 DENV genomes (5 serotype 1, 16 serotype 
      2 [DENV-2], and 8 serotype 3). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the endemic
      nature of DENV-2 in Burkina Faso. We noted discordant diagnostic results,
      probably related to genetic divergence between these genomes and the Trioplex
      PCR. Forward and reverse1 primers had a single mismatch when mapped to the DENV-2
      genomes, probably explaining the insensitivity of the molecular test. Although we
      observed considerable homogeneity between the Dengvaxia and TetraVax-DV-TV003
      vaccine strains as well as B cell epitopes compared with these genomes, we noted 
      unique divergence. Continual surveillance of dengue virus in Africa is needed to 
      clarify the ongoing novel evolutionary dynamics of circulating virus populations 
      and support the development of effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive 
      countermeasures.

PG  - 1146-1153
LID - 10.3201/eid2806.212317 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the effects of dengue virus (DENV) on semen using samples
      collected 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after symptom onset from 10 infected
      volunteers on Reunion Island. We assessed characteristics of semen and
      reproductive hormones and isolated motile spermatozoa from semen. We assayed
      semen for DENV using reverse transcription PCR and searched for DENV RNA by virus
      isolation in Vero E6 cell cultures. Four volunteers had >1 DENV RNA-positive
      semen samples; 2 volunteers had DENV RNA-positive semen at day 15 and 1 at day
      30. No motile sperm were DENV positive. After exposure to positive semen, few
      Vero E6 cells stained positive for DENV antigens, indicating low levels of
      replicative virus. We found DENV had shorter duration in semen than in blood.
      These findings support the possibilities that DENV is sexually transmissible for 
      a short period after acute dengue illness and that acute dengue induces
      reversible alterations in sperm.

TI  - Temephos, an organophosphate larvicide for residential use: a review of its
      toxicity.
PG  - 113-124
LID - 10.1080/10408444.2022.2065967 [doi]
AB  - Temephos (O,O,O',O'-tetramethyl O,O'-thiodi-p-phenylene bis(phosphorothioate)) is
      a larvicide belonging to the family of organophosphate pesticides used for the
      control of different vectors of diseases, such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and 
      dracunculiasis. The aim of this review was to discuss the available published
      information about temephos toxicokinetics and toxicity in mammals. Temephos is
      quickly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, distributed to all organs, and
      then it accumulates mainly in adipose tissue. It is metabolized by S-oxidation,
      oxidative desulfuration, and hydrolysis reactions, with the possible
      participation of cytochrome P450 (CYP). Temephos is mainly eliminated by feces,
      whereas some of its metabolites are eliminated by urine. The World Health
      Organization classifies it as class III: slightly dangerous with a NOAEL
      (no-observed adverse effect level) of 2.3 mg/kg/day for up to 90 days in rats,
      based on brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. A LOAEL (lowest observable
      adverse effect level) of 100 mg/kg/day for up to 44 days in rats was proposed
      based on cholinergic symptoms. However, some studies have shown that temephos
      causes toxic effects in mammals. The inhibition of the enzyme
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of its main demonstrated effects; however,
      this larvicide has also shown genotoxic effects and some adverse effects on male 
      reproduction and fertility, as well as liver damage, even at low doses. We
      performed an extensive review through several databases of the literature about
      temephos toxicokinetics, and we recommend to revisit current assessment of
      temephos with the new available data.

TI  - Dengue virus NS1 protein conveys pro-inflammatory signals by docking onto
      high-density lipoproteins.
PG  - e53600
LID - 10.15252/embr.202153600 [doi]
AB  - The dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a secreted virulence factor
      that modulates complement, activates immune cells and alters endothelial
      barriers. The molecular basis of these events remains incompletely understood.
      Here we describe a functional high affinity complex formed between NS1 and human 
      high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Collapse of the soluble NS1 hexamer upon binding
      to the lipoprotein particle leads to the anchoring of amphipathic NS1 dimeric
      subunits into the HDL outer layer. The stable complex can be visualized by
      electron microscopy as a spherical HDL with rod-shaped NS1 dimers protruding from
      the surface. We further show that the assembly of NS1-HDL complexes triggers the 
      production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human primary macrophages while NS1
      or HDL alone do not. Finally, we detect NS1 in complex with HDL and low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) particles in the plasma of hospitalized dengue patients and
      observe NS1-apolipoprotein E-positive complexes accumulating overtime. The
      functional reprogramming of endogenous lipoprotein particles by NS1 as a means to
      exacerbate systemic inflammation during viral infection provides a new paradigm
      in dengue pathogenesis.

AB  - Background: The wMel strain of Wolbachia has been successfully introduced into
      Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and subsequently shown to reduce transmission of dengue 
      and other pathogens, under both laboratory and field conditions. Here we describe
      the entomological outcomes of wMel Wolbachia mosquito releases in two small
      communities in Nha Trang City in central Vietnam. Methods: The wMel strain of
      Wolbachia was backcrossed into local Aedes aegypti genotype and mosquito releases
      were undertaken by community members or by staff. Field monitoring was undertaken
      to track Wolbachia establishment in local Ae. aegypti mosquito populations.
      Ecological studies were undertaken to assess relationships between environmental 
      factors and the spatial and temporal variability in Wolbachia infection
      prevalence in mosquitoes. Results: Releases of wMel Wolbachia Ae. aegypti
      mosquitoes in two small communities in Nha Trang City resulted in the initial
      establishment of Wolbachia in the local Ae. aegypti mosquito populations,
      followed by seasonal fluctuations in Wolbachia prevalence. There was significant 
      small-scale spatial heterogeneity in Wolbachia infection prevalence in the Tri
      Nguyen Village site, resulting in the loss of wMel Wolbachia infection in
      mosquitoes in north and center areas, despite Wolbachia prevalence remaining high
      in mosquitoes in the south area. In the second site, Vinh Luong Ward, Wolbachia
      has persisted at a high level in mosquitoes throughout this site despite similar 
      seasonal fluctuations in wMel Wolbachia prevalence. Conclusion: Seasonal
      variation in Wolbachia infection prevalence in mosquitoes was associated with
      elevated temperature conditions, and was possibly due to imperfect maternal
      transmission of Wolbachia. Heterogeneity in Wolbachia infection prevalence was
      found throughout one site, and indicates additional factors may influence
      Wolbachia establishment.

AB  - There were recent reports of a mysterious virus spreading in Pakistan causing
      dengue-like illness with hundreds of cases admitted to hospitals over the winter.
      The mysterious virus was touted as a new variant of the dengue virus by the local
      health experts in Pakistan as most patients were tested negative for the dengue
      virus test despite presenting with dengue-like symptoms. In this letter, we have 
      critically appraised the current situation in Pakistan in an attempt to explain
      the science and mechanism behind recent dengue-like outbreak, offered suggestions
      on diagnostic tests and provided recommendations to improve medication safety in 
      Pakistan.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of a Dengue IgG Rapid Diagnostic Test Designed to
      Determine Dengue Serostatus as Part of Prevaccination Screening.
PG  - e0071121
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00711-21 [doi]
AB  - The World Health Organization has recommended prevaccination screening for prior 
      dengue infection as the preferred approach prior to vaccination with the dengue
      vaccine CYD-TDV. These screening tests need to be highly specific and sensitive, 
      and deliverable at the point-of-care. We evaluate here the sensitivity and
      specificity of the newly developed OnSite Dengue IgG rapid diagnostic test (RDT).
      A retrospective double-blind study of the sensitivity and specificity of the
      OnSite Dengue IgG RDT was performed using a sample panel consisting of archived
      serum specimens collected during CYD-TDV clinical trials in Latin American and
      Asia, with the reference serostatus for each sample determined by an algorithm
      using measured dengue PRNT90, PRNT50, and NS1 IgG ELISA. An additional panel of
      dengue seronegative samples positive for other flaviviruses and infections was
      used to assess cross-reactivity. Samples were included from 579 participants; 346
      in the specificity panel and 233 in the sensitivity panel. The OnSite dengue IgG 
      RDT exhibited a specificity of 98.0% (95% CI = 95.9 to 99.2) and sensitivity of
      95.3% (95% CI = 91.7 to 97.6). The sensitivity for samples exhibiting a
      multitypic immune profile (PRNT90-positive to >1 dengue serotype) was 98.8% while
      for monotypic immune samples (PRNT90-positive to a single dengue serotype) it was
      88.1%. The OnSite dengue IgG RDT showed minimal to no cross-reactivity to related
      flaviviruses. These findings support the use of the OnSite dengue IgG RDT to
      determine dengue serostatus in CYD-TDV prevaccination screening. IMPORTANCE
      Dengue remains a significant public health issue, with over 5.2 million cases
      reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019. The tetravalent dengue
      vaccine (CYD-TDV) is currently licensed for use in those aged >/=9 years;
      however, vaccinees with no previous exposure to dengue experience an increased
      risk of hospitalized and severe dengue upon subsequent heterotypic infection.
      Consequently, WHO recommends screening for prior dengue infection before
      vaccination. Screening tests for previous infection need to be highly specific
      and sensitive, and deliverable at the point-of-care. High sensitivity ensures
      that the largest number of individuals with previous infection can be identified 
      and vaccinated, while high specificity prevents the inadvertent vaccination of
      those without previous infection. This study of the OnSite Dengue IgG Rapid Test,
      which was explicitly developed to meet this need, found that it had both high
      specificity (98.0% [95% CI = 95.9 to 99.2]) and sensitivity (95.3% [95% CI = 91.7
      to 97.6]).

AB  - Dengue virus is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and causes the disease
      known as dengue. In a trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine,
      Utarini and colleagues report that release of wolbachia-infected A. aegypti
      populations in a dengue endemic area reduces the number of symptomatic cases and 
      of hospitalisations.

AB  - Emodin is an anthraquinone derivative that is widely present in natural plants
      and has a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects, such as antibacterial,
      anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anticancer and so on. Through reviewing
      studies on antiviral effect of emodin in the past decades, we found that emodin
      exhibits ability of inhibiting the infection and replication of more than 10
      viruses in vitro and in vivo, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and
      type 2 (HSV-2), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),
      coxsackievirus B (CVB), hepatitis B virus (HBV), influenza A virus (IAV),
      SARS-CoV, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia rhabdovirus (VHSV), enterovirus 71
      (EV71), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Therefore, this
      review aims to summarize the antiviral effect of emodin, in order to provide
      reference and hopes to support the further investigations.

AB  - Vector-borne diseases are a major public health problem. Amongst them, dengue,
      Zika and chikungunya illnesses are increasing their incidence and geographical
      expansion. Since vector control is the main measure to prevent these diseases,
      this systematic review aims to determine the effectiveness of environmental
      interventions for the prevention of the transmission of these three diseases, as 
      well as for the reduction of their burden. Experimental studies of environmental 
      management interventions aimed at vector control were included. The outcome
      variables of interest were disease burden indicators and entomological
      indicators. Of the 923 references initially retrieved, after discarding those
      that were duplicated or didn't comply with the inclusion criteria, a total of 7
      articles were included. All included studies carried out environmental
      manipulation interventions and only 1 carried out an environmental modification
      intervention. Regarding the outcome variables, all used entomological indicators 
      (larval or pupae indices). Of those, pupae indices are better indicators of
      vector abundance. In 4 out of the 6 studies, there was a statistically
      significant reduction of the pupae indices related to the elimination of small
      containers, manipulation of large tanks and cleaning outdoor spaces. These
      interventions are easy to implement and involve little resources, which acquires 
      special importance regarding areas with limited resources. Although it is assumed
      that a reduction of mosquitoes would lead to a reduction or the risk of
      transmission, a little evidence proving this has been published. It would be
      advisable that, in addition to entomological indicators, epidemiological,
      environmental and sociodemographic factors would be taken into consideration,
      bearing in mind that mosquito density is one of the many factors that influence
      the transmission of these viruses. None of the papers included used disease
      indicators, not allowing to demonstrate if environmental interventions contribute
      to reduce disease burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current practice of child neurology in Latin America has been
      impacted by the waves of sociopolitical unrest that in the last decades have
      swept the region. METHODS: We searched the available literature referring to the 
      situation of child neurology in Latin America and conditions that specifically
      impact the region. RESULTS: In lower-middle-income countries, the number of child
      neurologists is inadequate. Child neurologists working in large public hospitals 
      can only afford to do so on a part-time basis as these institutions are
      chronically underfunded. Several circumstances are particularly relevant to Latin
      America: Spanish is the main language spoken, something that limits the
      opportunity to keep local child neurologists up to date. The structure of health 
      care systems in Latin America varies significantly. Some countries have
      fragmented systems with inadequate capacity to offer equitable access to medical 
      care. Latin America has been impacted by epidemics of arthropod-borne viruses:
      zika, chikungunya, and dengue. It stands to reason that the COVID-19 pandemic
      will affect the distribution of resources for chronic neurological conditions.
      CONCLUSIONS: The virtual platforms such as Zoom, expanded during the COVID-19
      pandemic, are useful not only to improve access to care through telemedicine but 
      also for educational purposes. Collaborative efforts to support educational
      courses and symposia in Spanish are ongoing. It is necessary to set short- and
      long-term priorities to improve child neurology care in the region. Immediate
      priorities should focus on improving the diagnosis of neurological conditions,
      making emphasis on locally available resources.

LID - 10.1002/jmv.27879 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4), affects
      millions of people in the tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Severe
      dengue is correlated with high viraemia and cytokine storm, such as high levels
      of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in the patient's serum. Here, the
      TGF-beta1 signaling was investigated in the context of in vitro viral clearance. 
      Macrophages were infected with DENV-2 at MOI 5 and treated with the TGF-beta
      receptor 1 and 2 inhibitor, GW788388. TGF-beta1 expression, signal transduction
      and viral load were evaluated 48 h after DENV-2 infection by enzyme-linked
      immunoassay, immunofluorescence, and RT-qPCR assays. Total TGF-beta1 level was
      reduced in 15% after DENV-2 infection, but the secretion of its biologically
      active form increased threefold during infection, which was followed by the
      phosphorylation of Smad2 protein. Phosphorylation of Smad2 was reduced by
      treatment with GW788388 and it was correlated with reduced cytokine production.
      Importantly, treatment led to a dose-dependent reduction in viral load, ranging
      from 6.6 x 10(5) RNA copies/ml in untreated cultures to 2.3 x 10(3) RNA copies/ml
      in cultures treated with 2 ng/ml of GW788388. The anti-TGF-beta1 antibody
      treatment also induced a significant reduction in viral load to 1.6 x 10(3) RNA
      copies/ml. On the other hand, the addition of recombinant TGF-beta1 in infected
      cultures promoted an increase in viral load to 7.0 x 10(6) RNA copies/ml. These
      results support that TGF-beta1 plays a significant role in DENV-2 replication
      into macrophages and suggest that targeting TGF-beta1 may represent an
      alternative therapeutic strategy to be explored in dengue infection.

TI  - Ultrasound-assisted nanoemulsion of Trachyspermum ammi essential oil and its
      constituent thymol on toxicity and biochemical aspect of Aedes aegypti.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-20870-2 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector of yellow fever, chikungunya, Zika, and dengue
      worldwide and is managed by using chemical insecticides. Though effective, their 
      indiscriminate use brings in associated problems on safety to non-target and the 
      environment. This supports the use of plant-based essential oil (EO) formulations
      as they are safe to use with limited effect on non-target organisms. Quick
      volatility and degradation of EO are a hurdle in its use; the present study
      attempts to develop nanoemulsions (NE) of Trachyspermum ammi EO and its
      constituent thymol using Tween 80 as surfactant by ultrasonication method. The NE
      of EO had droplet size ranging from 65 +/- 0.7 to 83 +/- 0.09 nm and a poly
      dispersity index (PDI) value of 0.18 +/- 0.003 to 0.20 +/- 0.07 from 1 to 60 days
      of storage. The NE of thymol showed a droplet size ranging from 167 +/- 1 to 230 
      +/- 1 nm and PDI value of 0.30 +/- 0.03 to 0.40 +/- 0.008 from 1 to 60 days of
      storage. The droplet shape of both NEs appeared spherical under a transmission
      electron microscope (TEM). The larvicidal effect of NEs of EO and thymol was
      better than BEs (Bulk emulsion) of EO and thymol against Ae. aegypti. Among the
      NEs, thymol (LC50 34.89 ppm) had better larvicidal action than EO (LC50 46.73
      ppm). Exposure to NEs of EO and thymol causes the shrinkage of the larval cuticle
      and inhibited the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in Ae. aegypti. Our
      findings show the enhanced effect of NEs over BEs which facilitate its use as an 
      alternative control measure for Ae. aegypti.

TI  - Economic burden of dengue fever in China: A retrospective research study.
PG  - e0010360
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010360 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever has been a significant public health challenge in China.
      This will be particularly important in the context of global warming, frequent
      international travels, and urbanization with increasing city size and population 
      movement. In order to design relevant prevention and control strategies and
      allocate health resources reasonably, this study evaluated the economic burden of
      dengue fever in China in 2019. METHODS: The economic burden of dengue fever
      patients was calculated from both family and the organisation perspectives. A
      survey was conducted among 1,027 dengue fever patients in Zhejiang, Chongqing,
      and Yunnan Provinces. Treatment expenses, lost working days, and insurance
      reimbursement expenses information were collected to estimate the total economic 
      burden of dengue fever patients in 2019. The expenditures related to dengue fever
      prevention and control from government, Center for Disease Control and Prevention
      (CDC), communities and subdistrict offices of 30 counties (or districts) in
      Zhejiang Province and Chongqing City were also collected. RESULTS: The direct,
      indirect and total economic burden for dengue fever patients in 2019 in the three
      Provinces were about 36,927,380.00 Chinese Yuan (CNY), 10,579,572.00 CNY and
      46,805,064.00 CNY, respectively. The costs for prevention and control of dengue
      fever for the counties (or districts) without cases, counties (or districts) with
      imported cases, and counties (or districts) with local cases are 205,800.00 CNY, 
      731,180.00 CNY and 6,934,378.00 CNY, respectively. The total investment of dengue
      fever prevention and control in the 30 counties in China in 2019 was
      approximately 3,166,660,240.00 CNY. CONCLUSION: The economic burden of dengue
      fever patients is relatively high, and medical insurance coverage should be
      increased to lighten patients' direct medical economic burden. At the same time, 
      the results suggests that China should increase funding for primary health
      service institutions to prevent dengue fever transmission.

TI  - Detection of pyrethroid resistance mutations and intron variants in the
      voltage-gated sodium channel of Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti and Aedes (Stegomyia)
      albopictus mosquitoes from Lao People's Democratic Republic.
LID - 10.1111/mve.12580 [doi]
AB  - In Lao People's Democratic Republic, Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus 1762) and Aedes
      albopictus (Skuse 1894) mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are vectors of arboviral 
      diseases such as dengue. As the treatment for these diseases is limited, control 
      of the vectors with the use of pyrethroid insecticides is still essential.
      However, mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) gene giving rise to
      pyrethroid resistance are threatening vector control programs. Here, we analysed 
      both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, which were collected in different
      districts of Laos (Kaysone Phomvihane, Vangvieng, Saysettha and Xaythany), for
      vgsc mutations commonly found throughout Asia (S989P, V1016G and F1534C).
      Sequences of the vgsc gene showed that the F1534C mutation was prevalent in both 
      Aedes species. S989P and V1016G mutations were detected in Ae. aegypti from each 
      site and were always found together. In addition, the mutation T1520I was seen in
      Ae. albopictus mosquitoes from Saysettha district as well as in all Ae. aegypti
      samples. Thus, mutations in the vgsc gene of Ae. aegypti are prevalent in the
      four districts studied indicating growing insecticide resistance throughout Laos.
      Constant monitoring programmes and alternative strategies for controlling Aedes
      should be utilized in order to prolong the effectiveness of pyrethroids thereby
      maximizing vector control.

TI  - Immunoglobulin M seroneutralization for improved confirmation of Japanese
      encephalitis virus infection in a flavivirus-endemic area.
LID - trac036 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/trac036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mainstay of diagnostic confirmation of acute Japanese
      encephalitis (JE) involves detection of anti-JE virus (JEV) immunoglobulin M
      (IgM) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Limitations in the
      specificity of this test are increasingly apparent with the introduction of JEV
      vaccinations and the endemicity of other cross-reactive flaviviruses. Virus
      neutralization testing (VNT) is considered the gold standard, but it is
      challenging to implement and interpret. We performed a pilot study to assess IgG 
      depletion prior to VNT for detection of anti-JEV IgM neutralizing antibodies
      (IgM-VNT) as compared with standard VNT. METHODS: We evaluated IgM-VNT in paired 
      sera from anti-JEV IgM ELISA-positive patients (JE n=35) and negative controls of
      healthy flavivirus-naive (n=10) as well as confirmed dengue (n=12) and Zika virus
      (n=4) patient sera. IgM-VNT was subsequently performed on single sera from
      additional JE patients (n=76). RESULTS: Anti-JEV IgG was detectable in admission 
      serum of 58% of JE patients. The positive, negative and overall percentage
      agreement of IgM-VNT as compared with standard VNT was 100%. A total of 12/14
      (86%) patient samples were unclassified by VNT and, with sufficient sample
      available for IgG depletion and IgG ELISA confirming depletion, were classified
      by IgM-VNT. IgM-VNT enabled JE case classification in 72/76 (95%) patients for
      whom only a single sample was available. CONCLUSIONS: The novel approach has been
      readily adapted for high-throughput testing of single patient samples and it
      holds promise for incorporation into algorithms for use in reference centres.

AB  - Currently, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the influent of wastewater treatment
      plants (WWTP), pumping stations, manholes, sewer networks and sludge of WWTP and 
      facilities of countries as France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, United States,
      Australia, Ecuador, Brazil and Japan. Although this virus has been detected in
      the wastewater streams, there is no robust method for its detection and
      quantification in wastewater. This review compiled and analyzed the virus
      concentration approaches applied to detect the SARS-CoV-2, besides to provide
      insights about the methodology for viral concentration, limit of detection,
      occurrence, persistence, and perspectives post-COVID-19 related with the
      implications of the virus presence in wastewater. The SARS-COV-2 detection in
      wastewater has been related to virus concentration methods, which present
      different recovery rates of the virus. The most used viral concentration methods 
      have been the polyethylene glycol (PEG) for precipitation of viral material and
      the ultrafiltration at molecular weight level. After viral concentration, the
      detection and quantification of SARS-COV-2 in wastewater are mainly via
      quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), which is 
      the clinical assay adapted for environmental purposes. Although in some
      experiments the positive control during RT-qPCR is running a surrogated virus
      (e.g., Mengovirus or Dengue virus), RT-qPCR or reverse transcription droplet
      digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) targeting the gene encoding nucleocapsid (N1, N2 and N3)
      of SARS-COV-2 are highly recommended to calculate the limit of detection in
      wastewater samples. Current results suggest that a rigorous methodology to
      elucidate the positive cases in a region from genomic copies in wastewater is
      needed.

TI  - Evidence for serial founder events during the colonization of North America by
      the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti.
PG  - e8896
LID - 10.1002/ece3.8896 [doi]
AB  - The Aedes aegypti mosquito first invaded the Americas about 500 years ago and
      today is a widely distributed invasive species and the primary vector for viruses
      causing dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever. Here, we test the hypothesis
      that the North American colonization by Ae. aegypti occurred via a series of
      founder events. We present findings on genetic diversity, structure, and
      demographic history using data from 70 Ae. aegypti populations in North America
      that were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci and/or ~20,000 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms, the largest genetic study of the region to date. We find evidence 
      consistent with colonization driven by serial founder effect (SFE), with Florida 
      as the putative source for a series of westward invasions. This scenario was
      supported by (1) a decrease in the genetic diversity of Ae. aegypti populations
      moving west, (2) a correlation between pairwise genetic and geographic distances,
      and (3) demographic analysis based on allele frequencies. A few Ae. aegypti
      populations on the west coast do not follow the general trend, likely due to a
      recent and distinct invasion history. We argue that SFE provides a helpful albeit
      simplified model for the movement of Ae. aegypti across North America, with
      outlier populations warranting further investigation.

TI  - Widespread interspecific phylogenetic tree incongruence between mosquito-borne
      and insect-specific flaviviruses at hotspots originally identified in Zika virus.
PG  - veac027
LID - 10.1093/ve/veac027 [doi]
AB  - Intraspecies (homologous) phylogenetic incongruence, or 'tree conflict' between
      different loci within the same genome of mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFV), was 
      first identified in dengue virus (DENV) and subsequently in Japanese encephalitis
      virus (JEV), St Louis encephalitis virus, and Zika virus (ZIKV). Recently, the
      first evidence of phylogenetic incongruence between interspecific members of the 
      MBFV was reported in ZIKV and its close relative, Spondweni virus. Uniquely,
      these hybrid proteomes were derived from four incongruent trees involving an
      Aedes-associated DENV node (1 tree) and three different Culex-associated
      flavivirus nodes (3 trees). This analysis has now been extended across a wider
      spectrum of viruses within the MBFV lineage targeting the breakpoints between
      phylogenetic incongruent loci originally identified in ZIKV. Interspecies
      phylogenetic incongruence at these breakpoints was identified in 10 of 50 viruses
      within the MBFV lineage, representing emergent Aedes and Culex-associated viruses
      including JEV, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and insect-specific viruses. 
      Thus, interspecies phylogenetic incongruence is widespread amongst the
      flaviviruses and is robustly associated with the specific breakpoints that
      coincide with the interspecific phylogenetic incongruence previously identified, 
      inferring they are 'hotspots'. The incongruence amongst the emergent MBFV group
      was restricted to viruses within their respective associated epidemiological
      boundaries. This MBFV group was RY-coded at the third codon position ('wobble
      codon') to remove transition saturation. The resulting 'wobble codon' trees
      presented a single topology for the entire genome that lacked any robust evidence
      of phylogenetic incongruence between loci. Phylogenetic interspecific
      incongruence was therefore observed for exactly the same loci between amino acid 
      and the RY-coded 'wobble codon' alignments and this incongruence represented
      either a major part, or the entire genomes. Maximum likelihood codon analysis
      revealed positive selection for the incongruent lineages. Positive selection
      could result in the same locus producing two opposing trees. These analyses for
      the clinically important MBFV suggest that robust interspecific phylogenetic
      incongruence resulted from amino acid selection. Convergent or parallel
      evolutions are evolutionary processes that would explain the observation, whilst 
      interspecific recombination is unlikely.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of Aedes albopictus midguts infected by dengue virus
      identifies a gene network module highly associated with temperature.
PG  - 173
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05282-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is prevalent worldwide and is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes.
      Temperature is a strong driver of dengue transmission. However, little is known
      about the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Aedes albopictus mosquitoes exposed or 
      not exposed to dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) were reared at 23 degrees C, 28
      degrees C and 32 degrees C, and midguts and residual tissues were evaluated at 7 
      days after infection. RNA sequencing of midgut pools from the control group,
      midgut breakthrough group and midgut nonbreakthrough group at different
      temperatures was performed. The transcriptomic profiles were analyzed using the R
      package, followed by weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and Kyoto
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis to identify the important
      molecular mechanisms regulated by temperature. RESULTS: The midgut infection rate
      and midgut breakthrough rate at 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C were significantly 
      higher than those at 23 degrees C, which indicates that high temperature
      facilitates DENV-2 breakthrough in the Ae. albopictus midgut. Transcriptome
      sequencing was performed to investigate the antiviral mechanism in the midgut.
      The midgut gene expression datasets clustered with respect to temperature,
      blood-feeding and midgut breakthrough. Over 1500 differentially expressed genes
      were identified by pairwise comparisons of midguts at different temperatures. To 
      assess key molecules regulated by temperature, we used WGCNA, which identified 28
      modules of coexpressed genes; the ME3 module correlated with temperature. KEGG
      analysis indicated that RNA degradation, Toll and immunodeficiency factor
      signaling and other pathways are regulated by temperature. CONCLUSIONS:
      Temperature affects the infection and breakthrough of Ae. albopictus midguts
      invaded by DENV-2, and Ae. albopictus midgut transcriptomes change with
      temperature. The candidate genes and key pathways regulated by temperature
      provide targets for the prevention and control of dengue.

AB  - Objective: To assess the incidence of dengue fever and E gene evolution of dengue
      virus in Guangzhou in 2020 and understand the local epidemiological
      characteristics of dengue fever and spreading of dengue virus. Methods: The
      information of dengue fever cases in Guangzhou in 2020 was collected from
      Notifiable Infectious Disease System of Chinese Center for Disease Control and
      Prevention Information System. Serum samples from the cases were detected by
      real-time PCR. The E gene was sequenced and analyzed. Maximum likelihood
      phylogenetic trees were constructed using software MEGA 5.05. The statistical
      analysis was conducted using software SPSS 20.0. Results: A total of 33 dengue
      fever cases were reported in Guangzhou in 2020, including 31 (93.94%) imported
      cases and 2 (6.06%) local cases. Compared with the data during 2016 to 2019, the 
      number of cases, overall incidence and local incidence all decreased with
      statistically significant differences (all P<0.05). The imported cases from
      Southeast Asia constituted 90.32% (28/31) of imported cases. The E gene sequences
      and the phylogenetic trees of imported and local cases demonstrated close
      relationship with the virus sequences from Southeast Asian, and they were less
      homologous with the sequences of dengue virus isolated in Guangzhou in previous
      years. Conclusions: The incidence of dengue in Guangzhou in 2020 was
      significantly affected by the imported cases, especially those from Southeast
      Asian countries. The study result demonstrated that dengue fever was not endemic 
      in Guangzhou and it was caused by imported ones.

AB  - The diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, such as dengue, chikungunya, yellow
      fever, and Zika, are ever-increasing. Rapid and unplanned urbanization adversely 
      impacts various endemic species such as ants and facilitates the breeding of
      Aedes mosquitoes. We have observed the predatory potential of ants over Aedes
      eggs in urban breeding habitats, and their impact on Aedes mosquito breeding was 
      determined by a field experiment that mimicked the natural breeding habitats. It 
      was found that 99.4% of eggs were removed from the experimental containers by
      foraging ants in 4 days. The present study demonstrates the role of ants as a
      natural regulator, limiting Aedes mosquito breeding.

TI  - A Cross-Sectional Household Survey in the US Virgin Islands (2019) Reveals
      Cisterns as Challenging Peridomestic Aedes aegypti Habitats.
PG  - 113-117
LID - 10.2987/21-7022 [doi]
AB  - Most residences in the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) rely on household
      rainwater-catchment systems and subterranean cisterns for long-term water storage
      that may provide suitable habitats for mosquitoes of public health relevance. We 
      conducted a household cistern survey (n = 164) on the islands of St. Croix, St.
      John, and St. Thomas in 2019. The survey revealed that 45.7% (95% CI: 38.3-53.4%)
      of cisterns contained mosquitoes (adult and/or immature mosquitoes). Aedes
      aegypti, a vector of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses in the USVI, was found
      in 27.4% (95% CI: 21.2-34.7%) of cisterns and accounted for 83.3% of the total
      mosquitoes identified in the study. The odds of detecting mosquitoes in a cistern
      were 5.45 times higher at locations where the residents reported that they had
      observed adult mosquitoes coming out of their cisterns (95% CI: 2.25-14.21),
      suggesting that vector control personnel should consider resident complaints
      about mosquitoes in their cistern as valid and likely reliable self-assessments. 
      Resident mosquito management practices in cisterns did not correspond with
      decreased odds of mosquito detection. We conclude that cisterns in the USVI
      commonly provide habitat for immature and adult Ae. aegypti, which may decrease
      the effectiveness of area-wide mosquito control strategies. Additional studies
      are necessary to evaluate the importance of these cisterns as they relate to
      mosquito production and arbovirus transmission risk, and to assess physical and
      chemical control methods.

TI  - Cross-reactive antibodies facilitate innate sensing of dengue and Zika viruses.
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.151782 [doi]
LID - e151782 [pii]
AB  - The Aedes aegypti mosquito transmits both dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus
      (ZIKV) . Individuals in endemic areas are at risk for infection with both
      viruses, as well as for repeated DENV infection. In the presence of anti-DENV
      antibodies, outcomes of secondary DENV infection range from mild to life
      threatening. Furthermore, the role of cross-reactive antibodies on the course of 
      ZIKV infection remains unclear. We assessed the ability of cross-reactive DENV
      mAbs or polyclonal immunoglobulin isolated after DENV vaccination to upregulate
      type I IFN production by plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in response to both heterotypic 
      DENV- and ZIKV-infected cells. We found a range in the ability of antibodies to
      increase pDC IFN production and a positive correlation between IFN production and
      the ability of an antibody to bind to the infected cell surface. Engagement of Fc
      receptors on the pDC and engagement of epitope on the infected cell by the Fab
      portion of the same antibody molecule was required to mediate increased IFN
      production by providing specificity to and promoting pDC sensing of DENV or ZIKV.
      This represents a mechanism independent of neutralization by which preexisting
      cross-reactive DENV antibodies could protect a subset of individuals from severe 
      outcomes during secondary heterotypic DENV or ZIKV infection.

PG  - e0010398
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010398 [doi]
AB  - Most cases of dengue virus infection are mild, but severe cases can be fatal.
      Therefore, identification of factors associated with dengue severity is essential
      to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality. The objective of this study was
      to assess associations between nutritional status and dengue severity among Thai 
      children and adolescents. This retrospective cross-sectional study was based on
      the medical records of 355 patients with dengue treated at the Hospital for
      Tropical Disease (Bangkok, Thailand) from 2017 to 2019. Subjects were Thai
      children aged less than 18 years with dengue virus infection confirmed by
      positive NS1 antigen or IgM. The 1997 and 2009 World Health Organization (WHO)
      dengue classifications were used to define disease severity and body mass index
      for age while the WHO growth chart was used to classify nutritional status. The
      proportions of patients with dengue fever who were underweight, normal weight,
      and overweight were 8.8%, 61.5%, and 29.7%, respectively. The proportions of
      patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) who were underweight, normal
      weight, and overweight were 10.2%, 66.1%, and 23.7%, respectively. The
      proportions of patients with non-severe dengue who were underweight, normal
      weight, and overweight were 8.6%, 60.9%, and 30.5%, respectively; the same
      proportions of patients with severe dengue were 10.5%, 67.1%, and 22.4%,
      respectively. Higher proportions of patients with severe plasma leakage (DHF
      grade III and IV) were overweight compared with those with mild plasma leakage
      (DHF grade I and II) (45.5% vs. 18.8%). No difference in nutritional status was
      observed in patients with different dengue severity.

TI  - Anti-Dengue Activity of ZnO Nanoparticles of Crude Fucoidan from Brown Seaweed
      S.marginatum.
LID - 10.1007/s12010-022-03966-w [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever is a rapidly spreading infection that affects people all over the
      tropics and subtropics, posing a significant public health threat. The brown
      seaweed Stoechospermum marginatum was found all over the world, from South Africa
      (Indian Ocean) to Australia (Pacific Ocean), among other places. In India, it is 
      only available along the coast of the Bay of Bengal, which is a small region.
      Various metal oxides were proved to be successful in the formation of
      nanoparticles and zinc is one among them. In this present study, an attempt was
      made to study the anti-dengue activity of green synthesized zinc oxide
      nanoparticles of crude fucoidan isolated from brown seaweed S. marginatum. The
      fucoidan was isolated from the seaweed by acid extraction method and then
      characterized by UV, HPLC, and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FT-IR) Spectroscopy. 
      Then it was biosynthesized into ZnO nanoparticles and characterized by SEM-EDAX
      analysis. The results showed the formation of fucoidans and SEM studies showed
      the crystalline nature of the synthesized nanoparticles. The size of
      nanoparticles was in the range of 80-126 nm. The synthesized nanoparticles were
      tested with the C6/36 cell line and it was shown 99.09% of anti-dengue activity
      against the tested cell line. As an antiviral agent, the ZnO nanoparticles of
      fucoidans have been shown to be an excellent lead molecule for the treatment of
      dengue fever.

AB  - Climate change is adversely affecting the burden of infectious disease throughout
      the world, which is a health security threat. Climate-sensitive infectious
      disease includes vector-borne diseases such as malaria, whose transmission
      potential is expected to increase because of enhanced climatic suitability for
      the mosquito vector in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. Climatic
      suitability for the mosquitoes that can carry dengue, Zika, and chikungunya is
      also likely to increase, facilitating further increases in the geographic range
      and longer transmission seasons, and raising concern for expansion of these
      diseases into temperate zones, particularly under higher greenhouse gas emission 
      scenarios. Early spring temperatures in 2018 seem to have contributed to the
      early onset and extensive West Nile virus outbreak in Europe, a pathogen expected
      to expand further beyond its current distribution, due to a warming climate. As
      for tick-borne diseases, climate change is projected to continue to contribute to
      the spread of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis, particularly in North
      America and Europe. Schistosomiasis is a water-borne disease and public health
      concern in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia; climate
      change is anticipated to change its distribution, with both expansions and
      contractions expected. Other water-borne diseases that cause diarrheal diseases
      have declined significantly over the last decades owing to socioeconomic
      development and public health measures but changes in climate can reverse some of
      these positive developments. Weather and climate events, population movement,
      land use changes, urbanization, global trade, and other drivers can catalyze a
      succession of secondary events that can lead to a range of health impacts,
      including infectious disease outbreaks. These cascading risk pathways of causally
      connected events can result in large-scale outbreaks and affect society at large.
      We review climatic and other cascading drivers of infectious disease with
      projections under different climate change scenarios. Supplementary file1 (MP4

TI  - Distance to public transit predicts spatial distribution of dengue virus
      incidence in Medellin, Colombia.
PG  - 8333
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-12115-6 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a growing global threat in some of the world's most rapidly growing
      landscapes. Research shows that urbanization and human movement affect the
      spatial dynamics and magnitude of dengue outbreaks; however, precise effects of
      urban growth on dengue are not well understood because of a lack of sufficiently 
      fine-scaled data. We analyzed nine years of address-level dengue case data in
      Medellin, Colombia during a period of public transit expansion. We correlate
      changes in the spread and magnitude of localized outbreaks to changes in
      accessibility and usage of public transit. Locations closer to and with a greater
      utilization of public transit had greater dengue incidence. This relationship was
      modulated by socioeconomic status; lower socioeconomic status locations
      experienced stronger effects of public transit accessibility and usage on dengue 
      incidence. Public transit is a vital urban resource, particularly among low
      socioeconomic populations. These results highlight the importance of public
      health services concurrent with urban growth.

TI  - Machine Learning Based Forecast of Dengue Fever in Brazilian Cities using
      Epidemiological and Meteorological Variables.
LID - kwac090 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwac090 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a serious public health concern in Brazil and globally. In the absence 
      of a universal vaccine or specific treatments, prevention relies on vector
      control and disease surveillance. Accurate and early forecasts can help reduce
      the spread of the disease. In this study, we develop a model to predict monthly
      dengue cases in Brazilian cities one month ahead from 2007-2019. We compare
      different machine learning algorithms and feature selection methods using
      epidemiological and meteorological variables. We find that different models work 
      best in different cities, and a random forests model trained on monthly dengue
      cases performs best overall. It produces lower errors than a seasonal naive
      baseline model, gradient boosting regression, feed-forward neural network, and
      support vector regression. For each city, we compute the mean absolute error
      between predictions and true monthly dengue cases on the test set. For the median
      city, the error is 12.2 cases. This error is reduced to 11.9 when selecting the
      optimal combination of algorithm and input features for each city individually.
      Machine learning and especially decision tree ensemble models may contribute to
      dengue surveillance in Brazil, as they produce low out-of-sample prediction
      errors for a geographically diverse set of cities.

AB  - The genus Aedes (Diptera: Culicidae) includes species of great epidemiological
      relevance, particularly involved in transmission cycles of leading arboviruses in
      the Brazilian Amazon region, such as the Zika virus (ZIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), 
      Yellow fever virus (YFV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). We report here the first
      putatively complete sequencing of the mitochondrial genomes of Brazilian
      populations of the species Aedes albopictus, Aedes scapularis and Aedes serratus.
      The sequences obtained showed an average length of 14,947 bp, comprising 37
      functional subunits, typical in animal mitochondria (13 PCGs, 22 tRNA, and 2
      rRNA). The phylogeny reconstructed by Maximum likelihood method, based on the
      concatenated sequences of all 13 PCGs produced at least two non-directly related 
      groupings, composed of representatives of the subgenus Ochlerotatus and Stegomyia
      of the genus Aedes. The data and information produced here may be useful for
      future taxonomic and evolutionary studies of the genus Aedes, as well as the
      Culicidae family.

TI  - Molecular and genomic investigation of an urban outbreak of dengue virus serotype
      2 in Angola, 2017-2019.
PG  - e0010255
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010255 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The transmission patterns and genetic diversity of dengue virus
      (DENV) circulating in Africa remain poorly understood. Circulation of the DENV
      serotype 1 (DENV1) in Angola was detected in 2013, while DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) 
      was detected in 2018. Here, we report results from molecular and genomic
      investigations conducted at the Ministry of Health national reference laboratory 
      (INIS) in Angola on suspected dengue cases detected between January 2017 and
      February 2019. METHODS: A total of 401 serum samples from dengue suspected cases 
      were collected in 13 of the 18 provinces in Angola. Of those, 351 samples had
      complete data for demographic and epidemiological analysis, including age,
      gender, province, type of residence, clinical symptoms, as well as dates of onset
      of symptoms and sample collection. RNA was extracted from residual samples and
      tested for DENV-RNA using two distinct real time RT-PCR protocols. On-site whole 
      genome nanopore sequencing was performed on RT-PCR+ samples. Bayesian coalescent 
      models were used to estimate date and origin of outbreak emergence, as well as
      population growth rates. RESULTS: Molecular screening showed that 66 out of 351
      (19%) suspected cases were DENV-RNA positive across 5 provinces in Angola. DENV
      RT-PCR+ cases were detected more frequently in urban sites compared to rural
      sites. Of the DENV RT-PCR+ cases most were collected within 6 days of symptom
      onset. 93% of infections were confirmed by serotype-specific RT-PCR as DENV2 and 
      1 case (1.4%) was confirmed as DENV1. Six CHIKV RT-PCR+ cases were also detected 
      during the study period, including 1 co-infection of CHIKV with DENV1. Most cases
      (87%) were detected in Luanda during the rainy season between April and October. 
      Symptoms associated with severe dengue were observed in 11 patients, including 2 
      with a fatal outcome. On-site nanopore genome sequencing followed by genetic
      analysis revealed an introduction of DENV2 Cosmopolitan genotype (also known as
      DENV2-II genotype) possibly from India in or around October 2015, at least 1 year
      before its detection in the country. Coalescent models suggest relatively
      moderately rapid epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and a moderate
      expansion of DENV2 in Angola during the studied period. CONCLUSION: This study
      describes genomic, epidemiological and demographic characteristic of
      predominately urban transmission of DENV2 in Angola. We also find co-circulation 
      of DENV2 with DENV1 and CHIKV and report several RT-PCR confirmed severe dengue
      cases in the country. Increasing dengue awareness in healthcare professional,
      expanding the monitorization of arboviral epidemics across the country,
      identifying most common mosquito breeding sites in urban settings, implementing
      innovative vector control interventions and dengue vaccination campaigns could
      help to reduce vector presence and DENV transmission in Angola.

AB  - Background and aim: Dengue a worldwide concern for public health has no effective
      vaccine or drug available for its prevention or treatment. There are billions of 
      people who are at risk of contracting the dengue virus (DENV) infections with
      only anti-mosquito strategies to combat this disease. Based on the reports,
      particularly in vitro studies and small animal studies showing anti-viral
      activity of aqueous extract of Cocculus hirsutus (AQCH), studies were conducted
      on AQCH tablets as a potential for the treatment of dengue and COVID-19
      infections. The current study was part of the research on AQCH tablet formulation
      and was aimed to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics in healthy human subjects. 
      Materials and methods: Sixty healthy adult human subjects were divided into 5
      groups (cohorts: I to V; n = 12 per cohort) and randomized in the ratio of 3:1 to
      receive active treatment or placebo in a blinded manner. Five doses 100 mg, 200
      mg, 400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg tablets were administered three times daily at an
      interval of 8 h for days 01-09 under fasting conditions and a single dose in
      morning on day 10. Safety assessment was based on monitoring the occurrence,
      pattern, intensity, and severity of adverse events during study period. Blood
      samples were collected for measurement of the bio-active marker Sinococuline
      concentrations by a validated LC-MS/MS method followed by pharmacokinetic
      evaluation. Results and conclusion: The test formulation was well tolerated in
      all cohorts. Sinococuline peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and total exposure of 
      plasma concentration (AUC) demonstrated linearity up to 600 mg and saturation
      kinetics at 800 mg dose. There was no difference observed in elimination
      half-life for all the cohorts, suggesting absence of saturation in rate of
      elimination. Dose accumulation was observed and steady state was achieved within 
      3 days. The information on human pharmacokinetics of AQCH tablets would assist in
      further dose optimization with defined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic
      relationship.

TI  - Chemokine PF4 Inhibits EV71 and CA16 Infections at the Entry Stage.
PG  - e0043522
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00435-22 [doi]
AB  - Platelet factor 4 (PF4) or the CXC chemokine CXCL4 is the most abundant protein
      within the alpha-granules of platelets. Previous studies found that PF4 regulates
      infections of several viruses, including HIV-1, H1N1, hepatitis C virus (HCV),
      and dengue virus. Here, we show that PF4 is an inhibitor of enterovirus A71
      (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) infections. The secreted form of PF4 from
      transfected cells or soluble purified PF4 from Escherichia coli, even lacking
      signal peptide affected secretion, obviously inhibited the propagation of EV71
      and CA16. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PF4 blocked the entry of the
      virus into the host cells by interactions with VP3 proteins of EV71/CA16 and the 
      interaction with SCARB2 receptor-mediated EV71 and CA16 endocytosis. As expected,
      the incubation of anti-PF4 antibody with PF4 blocked PF4 inhibition on EV71 and
      CA16 infections further supported the above conclusion. Importantly, pretreatment
      of EV71 viruses with PF4 significantly protected the neonatal mice from EV71
      lethal challenge and promoted the survival rate of infected mice. PF4 derived
      from natural platelets by EV71/CA16 activation also presented strong inhibition
      on EV71 and CA16. In summary, our study identified a new host factor against EV71
      and CA16 infections, providing a novel strategy for EV71 and CA16 treatment.
      IMPORTANCE The virus's life cycle starts with binding to cell surface receptors, 
      resulting in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Targeting the entry of the virus into
      target cells is an effective strategy to develop a novel drug. EV71 and CA16 are 
      the major pathogens that cause hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) outbreaks
      worldwide since 2008. However, the treatment of EV71 and CA16 infections is
      mainly symptomatic because there is no approved drug. Therefore, the underlying
      pathogenesis of EV71/CA16 and the interaction between host-EV71/CA16 need to be
      further investigated to develop an inhibitor. Here, we identified PF4 as a potent
      entry inhibitor of EV71 and CA16 via binding to VP3 proteins of EV71 and CA16 or 
      binding to receptor SCARB2. In the EV71 infection model, PF4 protected mice from 
      EV71 lethal challenge and promoted the survival rate of EV71-infected mice. Our
      study suggests that PF4 represents a potential candidate host factor for
      anti-EV71 and CA16 infections.

TI  - Clinicopathological alteration of symptoms with serotype among dengue infected
      pediatric patients.
PG  - 4348-4358
LID - 10.1002/jmv.27862 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever is a self-limiting, acute febrile illness caused by an arbovirus.
      This infection may be asymptomatic or symptomatic with its potential
      life-threatening form as DHF/DSS. Severe dengue cases occur typically in children
      due to overproduction of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines (called 
      cytokines storm) as well as increased microvascular permeability in them. This
      study aimed to find circulating dengue serotype and their clinicopathological
      association among pediatric patients admitted to tertiary care hospitals in
      Kolkata, India. Overall, 210 patients were approached, among them, 170 dengue
      suspected children admitted to three tertiary care hospitals were included in
      this study. Dengue samples were screened for the presence of dengue NS1 antigen
      and IgM antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Viral RNA was extracted 
      from NS1 seropositive serum samples and subjected to molecular serotyping by
      semi-nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. All patients were
      followed up for clinical manifestations and biochemical parameters associated
      with dengue. Cocirculation of all four serotypes was observed and DENV2 was the
      major circulating strain. Physiological classification of associated clinical
      symptoms was done as per WHO guideline and represented as a percentage variable. 
      A multivariate logistic regression approach was used for making a regression
      model including dengue-associated clinical symptoms with dengue positivity or
      negativity as dependent variables. Thrombocytopenia was observed in 69% of
      patients and the commonest bleeding manifestation was petechia. Liver function
      profiles of infected patients were observed during follow-up and represented
      using a box plot. A significant change in trends of dengue-associated clinical
      manifestations and differential expression of liver functional profile with
      different phases of transition of dengue fever was observed in this study
      population.

TI  - Direct and indirect costs for hospitalized patients with dengue in Southern Sri
      Lanka.
PG  - 657
LID - 10.1186/s12913-022-08048-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Southern Province of Sri Lanka is endemic with dengue, with
      frequent outbreaks and occurrence of severe disease. However, the economic burden
      of dengue is poorly quantified. Therefore, we conducted a cost analysis to assess
      the direct and indirect costs associated with hospitalized patients with dengue
      to households and to the public healthcare system. METHODS: From June
      2017-December 2018, we prospectively enrolled children and adults with acute
      dengue hospitalized at the largest, public tertiary-care (1800 bed) hospital in
      the Southern Province, Sri Lanka. We administered a structured questionnaire to
      obtain information regarding direct costs spent by households on medical visits, 
      medications, laboratory testing, and travel for seeking care for the illness.
      Indirect costs lost by households were estimated by identifying the days of work 
      lost by patients and caregivers and school days lost by children. Direct hospital
      costs were estimated using gross costing approach and adjusted by multiplying by 
      annual inflation rates in Sri Lankan rupees and converted to US dollars. RESULTS:
      A total of 1064 patients with laboratory-confirmed dengue were enrolled. The mean
      age (SD) was 35.9 years (15.6) with male predominance (66.2%). The mean durations
      of hospitalization for adults and paediatric patients were 3.86 (SD = 1.51) and 4
      (SD = 1.32) days, respectively. The per-capita direct cost borne by the
      healthcare system was 233.76 USD, and was approximately 14 times greater than the
      per-capita direct cost borne by households (16.29 USD, SD = 14.02). The
      per-capita average number of loss of working days was 21.51 (SD = 41.71), with
      mean per-capita loss of income due to loss of work being 303.99 USD (SD =
      569.77), accounting for over 70% of average monthly income. On average, 10.88
      days (SD = 10.97) of school days were missed due to the dengue episode. School
      misses were expected to reduce future annual income of affected children by
      0.44%. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue requiring hospitalization had a substantial economic
      burden on the public healthcare system in Sri Lanka and the affected households. 
      These findings emphasize the importance of strengthening dengue control
      activities and improved use of hospital-based resources for care to reduce the
      economic impact of dengue in Sri Lanka.

AB  - Mosquitoes are globally distributed and adapted to a broad range of environmental
      conditions. As obligatory hosts of many infectious pathogens, mosquito abundance 
      and distribution are primarily determined by the presence and quality of larval
      habitats. To understand the dynamics and productivity of larval habitats in
      changing island environments, we conducted a four-month mosquito survey across
      ten inhabited islands in the Lakshadweep archipelago. Using fine-resolution
      larval habitat mapping, we recorded 7890 mosquitoes representing 13 species and 7
      genera. Of these, four species comprised 95% of the total collections-Aedes
      albopictus (Stegomyia) was the dominant species followed by Armigeres subalbatus,
      Culex quinquefasciatus and Malaya genurostris. We found larval species richness
      was positively associated with the island area and mosquito larval richness
      (Chao1 estimator) was higher in artificial habitats than in natural habitats.
      Furthermore, mosquito species composition did not deteriorate with distance
      between islands. Mosquito abundance by species was associated with microclimatic 
      variables-pH and temperature. We detected co-existence of multiple species at a
      micro-habitat level with no evidence of interactions like competition or
      predation. Our study analyzed and identified the most productive larval habitats 
      -discarded plastic container and plastic drums contributing to high larval
      indices predicting dengue epidemic across the Lakshadweep islands. Our data
      highlight the need to devise vector control strategies by removal of
      human-induced plastic pollution (household waste) which is a critical driver of
      disease risk.

TI  - A retrospective study of environmental predictors of dengue in Delhi from 2015 to
      2018 using the generalized linear model.
PG  - 8109
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-12164-x [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne infection with a rising trend, expected to
      increase further with the rise in global temperature. The study aimed to use the 
      environmental and dengue data 2015-2018 to examine the seasonal variation and
      establish a probabilistic model of environmental predictors of dengue using the
      generalized linear model (GLM). In Delhi, dengue cases started emerging in the
      monsoon season, peaked in the post-monsoon, and thereafter, declined in early
      winter. The annual trend of dengue cases declined, but the seasonal pattern
      remained alike (2015-18). The Spearman correlation coefficient of dengue was
      significantly high with the maximum and minimum temperature at 2 months lag, but 
      it was negatively correlated with the difference of average minimum and maximum
      temperature at lag 1 and 2. The GLM estimated beta coefficients of environmental 
      predictors such as temperature difference, cumulative rainfall, relative humidity
      and maximum temperature were significant (p < 0.01) at different lag (0 to 2),
      and maximum temperature at lag 2 was having the highest effect (IRR 1.198). The
      increasing temperature of two previous months and cumulative rainfall are the
      best predictors of dengue incidence. The vector control should be implemented at 
      least 2 months ahead of disease transmission (August-November).

LID - 10.1016/j.jpeds.2022.05.016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe anthropometric, sensory, and neurodevelopmental outcomes
      of children who were Zika virus-exposed from birth to 36 months. STUDY DESIGN:
      The study cohort included 114 children born to mothers with confirmed and
      probable Zika virus pregnancy infection in 2016-2017. Children attending study
      visits from May 2017 through February 2020 underwent physical/neurologic, sensory
      examinations, and neurodevelopmental assessments with the Bayley Scales of Infant
      and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III) and Ages and Stages
      Questionnaires, Third Edition (ASQ-3). RESULTS: Three of the 114 children (2.6%) 
      had microcephaly (z-score for head circumference </=-2) at birth, 19 of 35
      (54.3%) had posterior eye abnormalities in retinal images, and 11 of 109 (10.1%) 
      had nonspecific findings on brain ultrasound. Three of 107 children (2.8%) failed
      hearing screening at birth. Of those children with follow-up data, 17 of 97
      (17.5%) failed age-appropriate vision screening. The BSID-III identified
      developmental delay in at least 1 domain in at least one-third of children, with 
      higher prevalence in the language domain. ASQ-3 screen positive delay peaked at
      around 24 or 36 months, with some domains showing a decrease at older ages.
      Correlations among BSID-III and ASQ-3 scores were observed, representing
      professional and parental perspectives at 24 and 36 months (r = 0.32-0.78; P <
      .05). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of neurodevelopmental sequelae in early childhood
      suggests that identification of long-term impairment remains critical to
      attaining optimal child development. Long-term follow-up highlights vulnerability
      in the language domain, which likely could be influenced by early intervention,
      promoting cognitive development and school readiness in exposed children.

      Scenario in Human Cell Lines.
PG  - 821061
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.821061 [doi]
AB  - The Dengue virus (DENV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are the arboviruses that
      pose a threat to global public health. Coinfection and antibody-dependent
      enhancement are major areas of concern during DENV and CHIKV infections, which
      can alter the clinical severity. Acute hepatic illness is a common manifestation 
      and major sign of disease severity upon infection with either dengue or
      chikungunya. Hence, in this study, we characterized the coexistence and
      interaction between both the viruses in human hepatic (Huh7) cells during the
      coinfection/superinfection scenario. We observed that prior presence of or
      subsequent superinfection with DENV enhanced CHIKV replication. However, prior
      CHIKV infection negatively affected DENV. In comparison to monoinfection,
      coinfection with both DENV and CHIKV resulted in lower infectivity as compared to
      monoinfections with modest suppression of CHIKV but dramatic suppression of DENV 
      replication. Subsequent investigations revealed that subneutralizing levels of
      DENV or CHIKV anti-sera can respectively promote the ADE of CHIKV or DENV
      infection in FcgammaRII bearing human myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. Our
      observations suggest that CHIKV has a fitness advantage over DENV in hepatic
      cells and prior DENV infection may enhance CHIKV disease severity if the patient 
      subsequently contracts CHIKV. This study highlights the natural possibility of
      dengue-chikungunya coinfection and their subsequent modulation in human hepatic
      cells. These observations have important implications in regions where both
      viruses are prevalent and calls for proper management of DENV-CHIKV coinfected
      patients.

AB  - Dengue fever has become one of the deadliest infectious diseases and requires the
      development of effective antiviral therapies. It is caused by members of the
      Flaviviridae family, which also cause various infections in humans, including
      dengue fever, tick-borne encephalitis, West Nile fever, and yellow fever. In
      addition, since 2019, dengue-endemic regions have been grappling with the public 
      health and socio-economic impact of the ongoing coronavirus disease 19.
      Co-infections of coronavirus and dengue fever cause serious health complications 
      for people who also have difficulty managing them. To identify the potentials of 
      mangiferin, a molecular docking with various dengue virus proteins was performed.
      In addition, to understand the gene interactions between human and dengue genes, 
      Cytoscape was used in this research. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
      software was used to find the paths of Flaviviridae. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of
      Genes and Genomes and the Reactome Pathway Library were used to understand the
      biochemical processes involved. The present results show that mangiferin shows
      efficient docking scores and that it has good binding affinities with all docked 
      proteins. The exact biological functions of type I interferon, such as
      interferon-alpha and interferon-beta, were also shown in detail through the
      enrichment analysis of the signaling pathway. According to the docking results,
      it was concluded that mangiferin could be an effective drug against the
      complications of dengue virus 1, dengue virus 3, and non-structural protein 5. In
      addition, computational biological studies lead to the discovery of a new
      antiviral bioactive molecule and also to a deeper understanding of viral
      replication in the human body. Ultimately, the current research will be an
      important resource for those looking to use mangiferin as an anti-dengue drug.

AB  - Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a reversible post-translational protein
      modifier. Protein SUMOylation regulates a wide variety of cellular processes and 
      is important for controlling virus replication. Earlier studies suggest that
      dengue virus envelope protein interacts with Ubc9, the sole E2-conjugating enzyme
      required for protein SUMOylation in mammalian cells. However, little is known
      about the effect of protein SUMOylation on dengue virus replication in the major 
      dengue vector, Aedes aegypti. Thus, in this study, we investigated the impact of 
      protein SUMOylation on dengue virus replication in A. aegypti. The transcription 
      of A. aegypti Ubc9 was significantly increased in the midgut after a normal blood
      meal. Silencing AaUbc9 resulted in significant inhibition of dengue virus NS1
      protein production, viral genome transcription, and reduced viral titer in the
      mosquito saliva. In addition, we showed that dengue virus E proteins and prM
      proteins were SUMOylated post-infection. The amino acid residues K51 and K241 of 
      dengue virus E protein were essential for protein SUMOylation. Taken together,
      our results reveal that protein SUMOylation contributes to dengue virus
      replication and transmission in the mosquito A. aegypti. This study introduces
      the possibility that protein SUMOylation is beneficial for virus replication and 
      facilitates virus transmission from the mosquito.

AB  - COVID-19 is the important global problem. Lockdown is a general disease control
      measure against COVID-19. The aim of lockdown is the reduce incidence of
      COVID-19. From reappraisal on the available data from a tropical endemic country 
      (1), the change of incidences of both COVID-19 and rotavirus infection incidence 
      after lockdown can be seen.

AB  - Vector-borne diseases represent a real threats worldwide, in reason of the lack
      of vaccine and cure for some diseases. Among arthropod vectors, mosquitoes are
      described to be the most dangerous animal on earth, resulting in an estimated
      725,000 deaths per year due to their borne diseases. Geographical position of
      Algeria makes this country a high risk area for emerging and re-emerging
      diseases, such as dengue coming from north (Europe) and malaria from south
      (Africa). To prevent these threats, rapid and continuous surveillance of mosquito
      vectors is essential. For this purpose we aimed in this study to create a
      mosquito vectors locale database using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry technology for
      rapid identification of these arthropods. This methodology was validated by
      testing 211 mosquitoes, including four species (Aedes albopictus, Culex pipiens, 
      Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culiseta longiareolata), in two northern wilayahs of 
      Algeria (Algiers and Bejaia). Species determination by MALDI TOF MS was highly
      concordant with reference phenotypic and genetic methods. Using this MALDI-TOF MS
      tool will allow better surveillance of mosquito species able to transmit mosquito
      borne diseases in Algeria.

AB  - Herbal extracts are re-emerging as potential remedies for various vector-borne
      diseases. Amongst several phytochemicals, active ingredients of Andrographis
      paniculata extract is regarded as promising for dengue fever, caused by Aedes
      species. However, fingerprinting the active phytochemicals from herbal extracts
      are often relies on sophisticated analytical techniques which are not universally
      accessible. Herein, an electrochemically reduced graphene oxide on glassy carbon 
      electrode (ErGO/GCE) has been devised as user-friendly and cost-effective sensor 
      platform for fingerprinting of andrographolide (AG) in anti-dengue polyherbal
      formulation, i.e., Nilavembu kudineer powder. Confocal laser Raman and X-ray
      photoelectron spectral analyses revealed that the ErGO surfaces exert structural 
      defects augmenting the conductivity at the electrode interface. DFT
      investigations enabled that C-3 and C-18 OH groups in AG is involved in the
      electrooxidation and adsorption-diffusion at the ErGO interface, respectively.
      Complementary electrochemical studies revealed that the diffusion-controlled
      process follows 1e(-)/1H(+) transfer. Under optimal experimental conditions, ErGO
      sensor platform exhibit an amplified current sensitivity of 13.3 muA muM(-1).
      cm(-2) in the studied analyte concentration range of 10-400 muM. From the
      polyherbal extract and clinical sample analysis, the proposed sensor system
      offers selective, and sensitive detection of target AG regardless of common
      interferents.

AB  - Since the COVID-19 outbreak, millions of people have been infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 around the world. An area of epidemiological relevance is Latin
      America, tropical regions, due to the distribution of endemic diseases such as
      chikungunya, dengue (DENV), malaria, Zika virus, where febrile disease abounds.
      The early signs and symptoms of DENV and COVID-19 could be similar, making it a
      risk that patients may be wrongly diagnosed early during the disease. The problem
      increases since COVID-19 infection can lead to false positives in DENV screening 
      tests. We present two cases of acute undifferentiated febrile syndrome that were 
      diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and DENV co-infection, confirmed by ELISA and RT-PCR
      for both viral pathogens. The occurrence of simultaneous or overlapped infections
      can alter the usual clinical course, severity, or outcome of each infection.
      Therefore, epidemiological surveillance and intensified preparation for those
      scenarios must be considered, as well as further studies should be done to
      address cases of co-infection promptly to avoid major complications and fatal
      outcomes during the current pandemic. Other endemic tropical diseases should not 
      be neglected.

AB  - Infections because of chikungunya and other mosquito-borne viruses, such as
      dengue and Zika, represent an area of significant unmet medical need. There are
      currently no approved medicines for prophylaxis or treatment of these diseases,
      and the development and implementation of vaccines against these viruses have
      proved problematic. Although antiviral molecules with treatment and prophylactic 
      potential against the chikungunya virus have been identified, no successful field
      trials have been reported. Chemoprophylaxis may be attractive for unvaccinated
      at-risk populations; however, performing a successful chemoprophylaxis trial
      during a chikungunya outbreak will require a clearly identifiable at-risk
      population. We propose the application of a household transmission model as used 
      in testing drugs against respiratory viruses. Current evidence on household
      clustering of chikungunya and other Aedes mosquito-borne viral infections is
      supportive. We suggest that this model may improve prophylaxis trial feasibility 
      and focus research and future treatment on a population likely to benefit.

AB  - Aedes albopictus is native to Asia and is ranked among the top 100 invasive
      species worldwide, with vector competence for dengue, Zika, and chikungunya
      viruses. Understanding Ae. albopictus dispersal is essential for effective
      monitoring and vector control strategies. In this study, we analysed and updated 
      the distribution of Ae. albopictus in Brazil using data available from the
      Ministry of Health through the Rapid Index Survey for Aedes (LIRA) for the years 
      2015-2020. The results of this research were mapped to visually represent the
      current distribution of Ae. albopictus in Brazil. In 2015, the presence of the
      vector was confirmed in 271 of the 1,820 Brazilian municipalities sampled
      (14.9%), and in 2020 it was detected in 728 of the 2,937 municipalities sampled
      (24.8%). In 2020, all Brazilian states had recorded the presence of this critical
      vector with a broader geographic distribution in the Southeast and Midwest
      regions as compared to the North, Northeast, and South regions. It was possible
      to note some stabilization of dispersion of this species in the Brazilian
      territory. The record of Ae. albopictus distribution advanced in Brazilian states
      and municipalities from 2015 to 2020; it is suggested that surveys of this vector
      be conducted periodically in all Brazilian municipalities and authorities should 
      developing control strategies for this species together with Ae. aegypti.

AB  - *Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) represent a threat to the health, wellbeing
      and economic prosperity of billions of people worldwide, often causing serious
      disease or death. *Commonly considered diseases of low and middle-income nations,
      the presence of NTDs in high income countries such as Australia is often
      overlooked. *Seven of the 20 recognised NTDs are endemic in Australia: scabies,
      soil-transmitted helminths and strongyloidiasis, echinococcosis, Buruli ulcer,
      leprosy, trachoma, and snakebite envenoming. *Dengue, while not currently
      endemic, poses a risk of establishment in Australia. There are occasional
      outbreaks of dengue fever, with local transmission, due to introductions in
      travellers from endemic regions. *Similarly, the risk of introduction of other
      NTDs from neighbouring countries is a concern. Many NTDs are only seen in
      Australia in individuals travelling from endemic areas, but they need to be
      recognised in health settings as the potential consequences of infection can be
      severe. *In this review, we consider the status of NTDs in Australia, explore the
      risk of introducing and contracting these infections, and emphasise the negative 
      impact they have on the health of Australians, especially Aboriginal and Torres
      Strait Islander peoples.

AB  - Dermatological diseases are among the most common travel-associated diseases. In 
      particular, viral infections not only with tropical and subtropical pathogens,
      but also with viruses common in Germany, which are often accompanied by skin
      rashes and general symptoms, are of great importance. In addition to an accurate 
      travel history and possible risk exposures, epidemiological information on
      country-specific risks in combination with molecular and serological analyses is 
      helpful in making the correct diagnosis. This article provides an overview of
      important virus-induced exanthems in returned travellers.

TI  - The Multifaceted Biology of PCSK9.
PG  - 558-582
LID - 10.1210/endrev/bnab035 [doi]
AB  - This article reviews the discovery of PCSK9, its structure-function
      characteristics, and its presently known and proposed novel biological functions.
      The major critical function of PCSK9 deduced from human and mouse studies, as
      well as cellular and structural analyses, is its role in increasing the levels of
      circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDLc), via its ability to 
      enhance the sorting and escort of the cell surface LDL receptor (LDLR) to
      lysosomes. This implicates the binding of the catalytic domain of PCSK9 to the
      EGF-A domain of the LDLR. This also requires the presence of the C-terminal
      Cys/His-rich domain, its binding to the secreted cytosolic cyclase associated
      protein 1, and possibly another membrane-bound "protein X". Curiously, in
      PCSK9-deficient mice, an alternative to the downregulation of the surface levels 
      of the LDLR by PCSK9 is taking place in the liver of female mice in a
      17beta-estradiol-dependent manner by still an unknown mechanism. Recent studies
      have extended our understanding of the biological functions of PCSK9, namely its 
      implication in septic shock, vascular inflammation, viral infections (Dengue;
      SARS-CoV-2) or immune checkpoint modulation in cancer via the regulation of the
      cell surface levels of the T-cell receptor and MHC-I, which govern the
      antitumoral activity of CD8+ T cells. Because PCSK9 inhibition may be
      advantageous in these processes, the availability of injectable safe PCSK9
      inhibitors that reduces by 50% to 60% LDLc above the effect of statins is highly 
      valuable. Indeed, injectable PCSK9 monoclonal antibody or small interfering RNA
      could be added to current immunotherapies in cancer/metastasis.

TI  - Evaluation of a multi-species Protein A-ELISA assay for plague serologic
      diagnosis in humans and other mammal hosts.
PG  - e0009805
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009805 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Hemagglutination assay (HA) is widely used in plague diagnosis,
      however, it has a subjective interpretation and demands high amounts of antigen
      and other immunobiological supplies. On the other hand, the conventional Anti-IgG
      ELISA is limited by the need of specific conjugates for multiple plague hosts,
      which leaves a gap for new diagnostic methods able to cover both the diagnosis of
      human cases and the epidemiological surveillance of multiple sentinel species.
      METHODS: We developed an ELISA Protein A-peroxidase method to detect anti-F1
      antibodies across several species, including humans. To determine the cut-off and
      performance rates, HA results from 288 samples (81 rabbits, 64 humans, 66 rodents
      and 77 dogs) were used as reference. Next, we evaluated the agreement between
      Protein A-ELISA and Anti-IgG ELISA in an expanded sample set (n = 487). RESULTS: 
      Optimal conditions were found with 250ng/well of F1 and 1:500 serum dilution.
      Protein A-ELISA showed high repeatability and reproducibility. We observed good
      correlation rates between the Protein A and IgG ELISAs optical densities and a
      higher positive/negative OD ratio for the Protein A-ELISA method. The overall
      sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve for Protein A-ELISA were 94%,
      99% and 0.99, respectively. Similar results were observed for each species
      separately. In the analysis of the expanded sample set, there was a strong
      agreement between Protein A and IgG assays (kappa = 0.97). Furthermore, there was
      no cross-reaction with other common infectious diseases, such as dengue, Zika,
      Chagas disease, tuberculosis (humans) and ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis and
      leishmaniasis (dogs). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the Protein A-ELISA showed high
      performance when compared both to HA and Anti-IgG ELISA, with a polyvalent single
      protocol that requires reduced amounts of antigen and can be employed to any
      plague hosts.

AB  - The enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses including Zika virus (ZIKV) need host
      lipids to successfully replicate. The nature of the lipids and the replication
      step(s) where lipids are utilized often vary amongst viruses. In this study, we
      demonstrate that ZIKV particle envelope is significantly enriched in distinct
      sphingolipid species. To determine the role of sphingolipids in ZIKV replication,
      we leveraged a panel of sphingolipid-deficient cell lines. Notably, knockout of
      glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide synthase encoding genes (GCS(KO); B4G5(KO))
      resulted in a marked decrease in ZIKV titers. GCS(KO) or pharmacological
      inhibition of GCS also led to a significant decrease in ZIKV genome replication. 
      Further analysis indicated that GCS(KO) reduced intracellular virus titers but
      had minimal impact on ZIKV binding. Restoration of B4G5 expression in B4G5(KO)
      cells or supplementing PDMP-treated cells with glucosylceramide led to a
      significant rescue of ZIKV replication. Altogether, our findings suggest that
      ZIKV needs glycosphingolipids to facilitate virus replication.

TI  - The knowledge, attitude and practice of community people on dengue fever in
      Central Nepal: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 454
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07404-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 2006, Nepal has experienced frequent Dengue fever (DF)
      outbreaks. Up to now, there have been no knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP)
      studies carried out on DF in Nepal that have included qualitative in-depth and
      quantitative data. Thus, we aimed to explore and compare the KAP of people
      residing in the lowland (< 1500 m) and highland (> 1500 m) areas of Nepal.
      METHODS: A cross-sectional mixed-method study was conducted in six districts of
      central Nepal in September-October 2018 including both quantitative (660
      household surveys) and qualitative data (12 focus group discussions and 27
      in-depth interviews). The KAP assessment was executed using a scoring system and 
      defined as high or low based on 80% cut-off point. Logistic regression was used
      to investigate the associated factors, in quantitative analysis. The deductive
      followed by inductive approach was adopted to identify the themes in the
      qualitative data. RESULTS: The study revealed that both the awareness about DF
      and prevention measures were low. Among the surveyed participants, 40.6% had
      previously heard about DF with a significantly higher number in the lowland
      areas. Similarly, IDI and FGD participants from the lowland areas were aware
      about DF, and it's associated symptoms, hence they were adopting better
      preventive practices against DF. The findings of both the qualitative and
      quantitative data indicate that people residing in the lowland areas had better
      knowledge on DF compared to people in highland areas. All IDI participants
      perceived a higher chance of increasing future dengue outbreaks due to increasing
      temperature and the mobility of infected people from endemic to non-endemic
      areas. The most quoted sources of information were the television (71.8%) and
      radio (51.5%). Overall, only 2.3% of the HHS participants obtained high knowledge
      scores, 74.1% obtained high attitude scores and 21.2% obtained high preventive
      practice scores on DF. Among the socio-demographic variables, the area of
      residence, educational level, age, monthly income, SES and occupation were
      independent predictors of knowledge level, while the education level of the
      participants was an independent predictor of the attitude level. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      study found a very low level of knowledge and insufficient preventive practices. 
      This highlights an urgent need for extensive dengue prevention programs in both
      highland and lowland communities of Nepal.

AB  - Dengue is an important arboviral disease in the tropics and subtropics. Although 
      mild to moderate elevation of liver transaminases is a common phenomenon, dengue 
      infection leading to hepatic failure is a rare complication in adults. We present
      a case of dengue fever in a young adult, leading to the rare complication of
      acute liver failure, without dengue shock syndrome. We tried evidence-based
      management with therapeutic plasma exchange, which led to a significant
      improvement in liver function.

TI  - Spatial dispersal of <em>Aedes albopictus</em> mosquitoes captured by the
      modified sticky ovitrap in Selangor, Malaysia.
LID - 10.4081/gh.2022.1025 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a major mosquito-borne disease in many tropical and sub-tropical
      countries worldwide, with entomological surveillance and control activities as
      the key management approaches. This study aimed to explore the spatial dispersal 
      of the vector Aedes albopictus, captured by the modified sticky ovitrap (MSO) in 
      residential areas with low-rise buildings in Selangor, Malaysia. Distribution
      maps were created and shown as temporally distinguished classes based on hotspot 
      analysis by Getis-Ord; spatial autocorrelation assessed by semivariograms using
      the exponential Kernel function; and universal Kriging showing areas with
      estimated high and low vector densities. Distribution, hotspot and interpolated
      maps were analysed based on the total number of mosquitoes by month and week. All
      maps in the present study were generated and visualised in ArcMap. Spatial
      autocorrelation of Ae. albopictus based on the monthly occurrence of Ae.
      albopictus was found in March, April, October, November and December 2018, and
      when based on the weekly numbers, in weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 25, 26, 27, 31,
      33, 42, 49 and 52. Semivariograms, based on the monthly and weekly numbers of Ae.
      albopictus, indicated spatial autocorrelation of the species extending between 50
      and 70 m. The mosquito density maps reported in this study may provide beneficial
      information to facilitate implementation of more efficient entomological control 
      activities.

      viruses (DENV-1-4) that are transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquito vectors. It is the
      most common arboviral disease worldwide, with the greatest burden in tropical and
      sub-tropical regions. In the absence of effective prevention and control
      measures, dengue is projected to increase in both disease burden and geographic
      range. Given its increasing importance as an etiology of fever in the returning
      traveler or the possibility of local transmission in regions in the United States
      with competent vectors, as well as the risk for large outbreaks in endemic US
      territories and associated states, clinicians should understand its clinical
      presentation and be familiar with appropriate testing, triage, and management of 
      patients with dengue. Control and prevention efforts reached a milestone in June 
      2021 when the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended
      Dengvaxia for routine use in children aged 9 to 16 years living in endemic areas 
      with laboratory confirmation of previous dengue virus infection. Dengvaxia is the
      first vaccine against dengue to be recommended for use in the United States and
      one of the first to require laboratory testing of potential recipients to be
      eligible for vaccination. In this review, we outline dengue pathogenesis,
      epidemiology, and key clinical features for front-line clinicians evaluating
      patients presenting with dengue. We also provide a summary of Dengvaxia efficacy,
      safety, and considerations for use as well as an overview of other potential new 
      tools to control and prevent the growing threat of dengue .

AB  - One of the main categories of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are arboviruses,
      of which Dengue and Chikungunya are the most common. Arboviruses mainly affect
      tropical countries. Brazil has the largest absolute number of cases in Latin
      America. This work presents a unified data set with clinical, sociodemographic,
      and laboratorial data on confirmed patients of Dengue and Chikungunya, as well as
      patients ruled out of infection from these diseases. The data is based on case
      notification data submitted to the Brazilian Information System for Notifiable
      Diseases, from Portuguese Sistema de Informacao de Agravo de Notificacao (SINAN),
      from 2013 to 2020. The original data set comprised 13,421,230 records and 118
      attributes. Following a pre-processing process, a final data set of 7,632,542
      records and 56 attributes was generated. The data presented in this work will
      assist researchers in investigating antecedents of arbovirus emergence and
      transmission more generally, and Dengue and Chikungunya in particular.
      Furthermore, it can be used to train and test machine learning models for
      differential diagnosis and multi-class classification.

TI  - Seropositivity for Coxiella burnetii in suspected patients with dengue in Sao
      Paulo state, Brazil.

AB  - Q fever and brucellosis are zoonoses that cause fever and other systemic clinical
      signs in humans; their occurrences are neglected and the differential diagnosis
      for some diseases is disregarded. This study aimed to investigate the
      seropositivity for Coxiella burnetii and Brucella spp. antibodies in patients
      suspected of dengue from 38 municipalities in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The
      samples (n = 604) were obtained by convenience from the Adolfo Lutz Institute
      serum bank. Sera were subjected to an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)
      using in-house and commercial diagnostic protocols to evaluate C. burnetii
      positivity. For Brucella spp., sera were subjected to rapid plate serum
      agglutination with buffered acidified antigen (AAT), slow tube serum
      agglutination (SAL), and 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) techniques. Associations and
      statistical inferences of the results were performed by logistic regression
      according to the clinical and demographic variables collected from the patients. 
      Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) and
      associations were considered when p value was <0.05. In all, 129 patients showed 
      positive results for Q fever, indicating a seropositivity of 21.4% (95% CI
      18.15-24.85). Patients with 14-20 days of symptoms had 2.12 (95% CI 1.34-3.35)
      times more chances of being seropositive for Q fever than patients with 7-13
      days, and patients with 21-27 days of fever had 2.62 (95% CI 1.27-5.41) times
      more chances of being seropositive for Q fever than patients with 7-13 days. For 
      the other variables analyzed, there were no significant associations between the 
      groups. No positivity for brucellosis was observed. This is the most
      comprehensive study of people seropositive for Q fever in Sao Paulo state and
      provides additional data for the medical community in Brazil. It is suggested
      that Q fever may be an important differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses in
      the region, demanding the government's attention and investment in health.

AB  - Dengue is a rapidly spreading arboviral disease that can be transmitted through
      any of the four types of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. Previous studies have
      observed that individuals who have a pre-existing secondary infection due to a
      different dengue serotype, experience severe forms of this disease. During a DENV
      outbreak, a time-sensitive preliminary diagnosis of the origin of DENV might be
      useful in controlling the epidemic. Here, we developed a rapid and accurate
      one-step TB Green RT-PCR-based high-resolution melting (HRM) assay to identify
      and serotype DENV using serotyping primers based on the alignment with the E
      gene. This assay had a detection limit of 7.7 x 10(2) (DENV 1), 3.8 x 10(2) (DENV
      2), 6.2 x 10(2) (DENV 3), and 1.2 x 10(3) (DENV 4) RNA copies/mL. No
      cross-reactivity with the Chikungunya, Zika, and Japanese encephalitis viruses
      was observed. The feasibility of using this assay for clinical diagnosis was
      evaluated in DENV-positive patient sera. The HRM assay and the RT-qPCR had
      complete matched results derived from DENV detection, including 51 serum positive
      and 20 serum negative. Additionally, eight DENV 2 strains in the same serotype
      were successfully differentiated by an HRM assay. Thus, this assay facilitated
      accurate detection and serotyping of DENV, along with the time-sensitive
      identification of the infectious focus of different DENVs.

TI  - Natural Aedes-Borne Virus Infection Detected in Male Adult Aedes aegypti
      (Diptera: Culicidae) Collected From Urban Settings in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico.
PG  - 1336-1346
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjac048 [doi]
AB  - Aedes-borne viruses (ABVs) such as dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika
      (ZIKV) contribute significantly to the global burden of infectious diseases,
      disproportionately affecting disadvantaged populations from tropical and
      subtropical urban areas. ABVs can be transmitted from female mosquitoes to their 
      progeny by vertical transmission via transovarial and/or trans-egg vertical
      transmission and contribute to the maintenance of infected-mosquito populations
      year-round in endemic regions. This study describes the natural infection rate of
      DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV in field-caught male Aedes (Sergentomyia) aegypti
      (Linnaeus) mosquitoes from Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, as a proxy for the occurrence
      of vertical virus transmission. We used indoor sequential sampling with Prokopack
      aspirators to collect all mosquitoes inside houses from ABV hotspots areas.
      Collections were performed in a DENV and CHIKV post-epidemic phase and during a
      period of active ZIKV transmission. We individually RT-qPCR tested all indoor
      collected Ae. aegypti males (1,278) followed by Sanger sequencing analysis for
      final confirmation. A total of 6.7% male mosquitoes were positive for ABV (CHIKV 
      = 5.7%; DENV = 0.9%; ZIKV = 0.1%) and came from 21.0% (30/143) houses infested
      with males. Most ABV-positive male mosquitoes were positive for CHIKV (84.8%).
      The distribution of ABV-positive Ae. aegypti males was aggregated in a few
      households, with two houses having 11 ABV-positive males each. We found a
      positive association between ABV-positive males and females per house. These
      findings suggested the occurrence of vertical arbovirus transmission within the
      mosquito populations in an ABV-endemic area and, a mechanism contributing to
      viral maintenance and virus re-emergence among humans in post-epidemic periods.

TI  - Dengue Early Warning System as Outbreak Prediction Tool: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 871-886
LID - 10.2147/RMHP.S361106 [doi]
AB  - Early warning system (EWS) for vector-borne diseases is incredibly complex due to
      numerous factors originating from human, environmental, vector and the disease
      itself. Dengue EWS aims to collect data that leads to prompt decision-making
      processes that trigger disease intervention strategies to minimize the impact on 
      a specific population. Dengue EWS may have a similar structural design,
      functions, and analytical approaches but different performance and ability to
      predict outbreaks. Hence, this review aims to summarise and discuss the evidence 
      of different EWSs, their performance, and their ability to predict dengue
      outbreaks. A systematic literature search was performed of four primary
      databases: Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, and EBSCOhost. Eligible articles
      were evaluated using a checklist for assessing the quality of the studies. A
      total of 17 studies were included in this systematic review. All EWS models
      demonstrated reasonably good predictive abilities to predict dengue outbreaks.
      However, the accuracy of their predictions varied greatly depending on the model 
      used and the data quality. The reported sensitivity ranged from 50 to 100%, while
      specificity was 74 to 94.7%. A range between 70 to 96.3% was reported for
      prediction model accuracy and 43 to 86% for PPV. Overall, meteorological alarm
      indicators (temperatures and rainfall) were the most frequently used and
      displayed the best performing indicator. Other potential alarm indicators are
      entomology (female mosquito infection rate), epidemiology, population and
      socioeconomic factors. EWS is an essential tool to support district health
      managers and national health planners to mitigate or prevent disease outbreaks.
      This systematic review highlights the benefits of integrating several
      epidemiological tools focusing on incorporating climatic, environmental,
      epidemiological and socioeconomic factors to create an early warning system. The 
      early warning system relies heavily on the country surveillance system. The lack 
      of timely and high-quality data is critical for developing an effective EWS.

AB  - Although many of the thoracic infections endemic to Africa are also present
      around the world, this article focuses on entities that are emerging or
      disproportionately affect populations living in sub-Saharan Africa. Important
      emerging or reemerging viral and bacterial diseases that commonly affect the lung
      include dengue fever, plague, leptospirosis, and rickettsioses. Most parasitic
      infections endemic to Africa can also manifest within the thorax, including
      malaria, amebiasis, hydatid disease, schistosomiasis, paragonimiasis, ascariasis,
      strongyloidiasis and cysticercosis. Level of sanitation, interaction between
      humans and host animals, climate change, political instability, and global travel
      all affect the distribution and burden of these diseases.

AB  - Despite substantial morbidity and mortality, no therapeutic agents exist for
      treatment of dengue or Zika, and the currently available dengue vaccine is only
      recommended for dengue virus (DENV)-immune individuals. Thus, development of
      therapeutic and/or preventive drugs is urgently needed. DENV and Zika virus
      (ZIKV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) can directly trigger endothelial barrier
      dysfunction and induce inflammatory responses, contributing to vascular leak in
      vivo. Here we evaluated the efficacy of the (1-6,1-3)-beta-D-glucan isolated from
      Agaricus subrufescens fruiting bodies (FR) and its sulfated derivative (FR-S)
      against DENV-2 and ZIKV infection and NS1-mediated pathogenesis. FR-S, but not
      FR, significantly inhibited DENV-2 and ZIKV replication in human monocytic cells 
      (EC50 = 36.5 and 188.7 mug/mL, respectively) when added simultaneously with viral
      infection. No inhibitory effect was observed when FR or FR-S were added
      post-infection, suggesting inhibition of viral entry as a mechanism of action. In
      an in vitro model of endothelial permeability using human pulmonary microvascular
      endothelial cells (HPMECs), FR and FR-S (0.12 mug/mL) inhibited DENV-2 NS1- and
      ZIKV NS1-induced hyperpermeability by 50% and 100%, respectively, as measured by 
      Trans-Endothelial Electrical Resistance. Treatment with 0.25 mug/mL of FR and
      FR-S inhibited DENV-2 NS1 binding to HPMECs. Further, FR-S significantly reduced 
      intradermal hyperpermeability induced by DENV-2 NS1 in C57BL/6 mice and protected
      against DENV-induced morbidity and mortality in a murine model of dengue vascular
      leak syndrome. Thus, we demonstrate efficacy of FR-S against DENV and ZIKV
      infection and NS1-induced endothelial permeability in vitro and in vivo. These
      findings encourage further exploration of FR-S and other glycan candidates for
      flavivirus treatment alone or in combination with compounds with different
      mechanisms of action.

      Thailand.
PG  - e2115790119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2115790119 [doi]
AB  - The mean age of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases increased considerably in
      Thailand from 8.1 to 24.3 y between 1981 and 2017 (mean annual increase of 0.45
      y). Alternative proposed explanations for this trend, such as changes in
      surveillance practices, reduced mosquito-human contact, and shifts in population 
      demographics, have different implications for global dengue epidemiology. To
      evaluate the contribution of each of these hypothesized mechanisms to the
      observed data, we developed 20 nested epidemiological models of dengue virus
      infection, allowing for variation over time in population demographics, infection
      hazards, and reporting rates. We also quantified the effect of removing or
      retaining each source of variation in simulations of the age trajectory. Shifts
      in the age structure of susceptibility explained 58% of the observed change in
      age. Adding heterogeneous reporting by age and reductions in per-serotype
      infection hazard to models with shifts in susceptibility explained an additional 
      42%. Reductions in infection hazards were mostly driven by changes in the number 
      of infectious individuals at any time (another consequence of shifting age
      demographics) rather than changes in the transmissibility of individual
      infections. We conclude that the demographic transition drives the overwhelming
      majority of the observed change as it changes both the age structure of
      susceptibility and the number of infectious individuals. With the projected Thai 
      population age structure, our results suggest a continuing increase in age of DHF
      cases, shifting the burden toward individuals with more comorbidity. These
      insights into dengue epidemiology may be relevant to many regions of the globe
      currently undergoing comparable changes in population demographics.

TI  - Concurrent dengue infections: Epidemiology & clinical implications.
PG  - 669-679
LID - 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1219_18 [doi]
AB  - Multiple dengue virus (DENV) serotypes circulating in a geographical area most
      often lead to simultaneous infection of two or more serotypes in a single
      individual. The occurrence of such concurrent infections ranges from 2.5 to 30
      per cent, reaching as high as 40-50 per cent in certain dengue hyper-endemic
      areas. Concurrent dengue manifests itself differently than mono-infected
      patients, and it becomes even more important to understand the effects of
      co-infecting serotypes in concurrent infections to ascertain the clinical
      outcomes of the disease progression and transmission. In addition, there have
      also been reports of concurrent DENV infections in the presence of other
      arboviral infections. In this review, we provide a comprehensive breakdown of
      concurrent dengue infections globally. Furthermore, this review also touches upon
      the clinical presentations during those concurrent infections categorized as mild
      or severe forms of disease presentation. Another aspect of this review was aimed 
      at providing insight into the concurrent dengue incidences in the presence of
      other arboviruses.

TI  - Development of HEK-293 Cell Lines Constitutively Expressing Flaviviral Antigens
      for Use in Diagnostics.
PG  - e0059222
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00592-22 [doi]
AB  - Flaviviruses are important human pathogens worldwide. Diagnostic testing for
      these viruses is difficult because many of the pathogens require specialized
      biocontainment. To address this issue, we generated 39 virus-like particle (VLP)-
      and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-secreting stable cell lines in HEK-293 cells of
      13 different flaviviruses, including dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis,
      West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, Zika, Rocio, Ilheus, Usutu, and Powassan
      viruses. Antigen secretion was stable for at least 10 cell passages, as measured 
      by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunofluorescence assays. Thirty-five 
      cell lines (90%) had stable antigen expression over 10 passages, with three of
      these cell lines (7%) increasing in antigen expression and one cell line (3%)
      decreasing in antigen expression. Antigen secretion in the HEK-293 cell lines was
      higher than in previously developed COS-1 cell line counterparts. These antigens 
      can replace current antigens derived from live or inactivated virus for safer use
      in diagnostic testing. IMPORTANCE Serological diagnostic testing for flaviviral
      infections is hindered by the need for specialized biocontainment for preparation
      of reagents and assay implementation. The use of previously developed COS-1 cell 
      lines secreting noninfectious recombinant viral antigen is limited due to
      diminished antigen secretion over time. Here, we describe the generation of 39
      flaviviral virus-like particle (VLP)- and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-secreting
      stable cell lines in HEK-293 cells representing 13 medically important
      flaviviruses. Antigen production was more stable and statistically higher in
      these newly developed cell lines than in their COS-1 cell line counterparts. The 
      use of these cell lines for production of flaviviral antigens will expand
      serological diagnostic testing of flaviviruses worldwide.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9 mediated sex-ratio distortion by sex specific gene editing in Aedes
      aegypti.
PG  - 3015-3022
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2022.01.034 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is a principal vector for several viruses including dengue virus,
      chikungunya virus and zika virus. Economic burden of mosquito-borne diseases,
      relative failure of traditional control strategies and the resistance development
      against insecticides enforces towards genetic manipulation of Ae. aegypti. Hence,
      a key gene doublesex (Aedsx) which regulate sex differentiation and alternatively
      splices to form male and female specific transcripts (Aedsx(M) and Aedsx(F) ).
      CRISPR/Cas9 technique was employed to sex specifically disrupt the
      female-specific isoforms, Aedsx(F1) and Aedsx(F2) , both of which were shown to
      be expressed only in female mosquitoes. Targeting of dsx(F) at the developmental 
      stage has resulted in various phenotypic anomalies of adult females. The rate of 
      adult mutation phenotype was recorded between 29 and 37% along with anomalies of 
      wing size, proboscis length and reduction in the sizes of pre-blood-meal and
      after blood-meal ovaries in dsx(F1) and dsx(F2) microinjected groups,
      respectively. These findings can be correlated with reduced fecundity rate of Go 
      female, where Aedsx(F1) and Aedsx(F2) groups showed reduction rate in range of
      23-31%. Furthermore, hatching inhibition rate of 28 to 36% was also observed in
      G1 generation when compared to the wildtype. Overall, these results demonstrated 
      that Aedsx(F) disruption has resulted in multiple female traits disruption
      including decreased fertility of the female that could directly or indirectly
      associated with reproduction and its disease transmitting abilities. All these
      findings suggesting that CRISPR works to alter the developmental pathways as
      predicted, and therefore this method potentially gives us the basis for the
      sex-ratio distortion system as genetic control approach for the management of
      this vector.

AB  - Dengue is the fastest emerging arboviral disease in the world, imposing a
      substantial health and economic burden in the tropics and subtropics. The
      mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is the primary vector of dengue in the Philippines. We
      examined the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations collected from the
      Philippine major islands (Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao), each with highland
      (Baguio city, Cebu city mountains and Maramag, Bukidnon, respectively) and
      lowland sites (Quezon city; Liloan, Cebu and Cagayan de Oro [CDO] city,
      respectively) during the wet (2017-2018 and 2018-2019) and dry seasons (2018 and 
      2019). Mosquitoes (n = 1800) were reared from field-collected eggs and immatures,
      and were analyzed using 12 microsatellite loci. Generalized linear model analyses
      revealed yearly variations between highlands and lowlands in the major islands as
      supported by Bayesian clustering analyses on: 1) stronger selection (inbreeding
      coefficient, FIS = 0.52) in 2017-2018 than in 2018-2019 (FIS = 0.32) as
      influenced by rainfall, 2) the number of non-neutral loci indicating selection,
      and 3) differences of effective population size although at p = 0.05. Across
      sites except Baguio and CDO cities: 1) FIS varied seasonally as influenced by
      relative humidity (RH), and 2) the number of non-neutral loci varied as
      influenced by RH and rainfall indicating selection. Human-mediated activities and
      not isolation by distance influenced genetic differentiations of mosquito
      populations within (FST = 0.04) the major islands and across sites (global FST = 
      0.16). Gene flow (Nm) and potential first generation migrants among populations
      were observed between lowlands and highlands within and across major islands. Our
      results suggest that dengue control strategies in the epidemic wet season are to 
      be changed into whole year-round approach, and water pipelines are to be
      installed in rural mountains to prevent the potential breeding sites of
      mosquitoes.

TI  - Nonparametric estimation of the causal effect of a stochastic threshold-based
      intervention.
LID - 10.1111/biom.13690 [doi]
AB  - Identifying a biomarker or treatment-dose threshold that marks a specified level 
      of risk is an important problem, especially in clinical trials. In view of this
      goal, we consider a covariate-adjusted threshold-based interventional estimand,
      which happens to equal the binary treatment-specific mean estimand from the
      causal inference literature obtained by dichotomizing the continuous biomarker or
      treatment as above or below a threshold. The unadjusted version of this estimand 
      was considered in Donovan et al.. Expanding upon Stitelman et al., we show that
      this estimand, under conditions, identifies the expected outcome of a stochastic 
      intervention that sets the treatment dose of all participants above the
      threshold. We propose a novel nonparametric efficient estimator for the
      covariate-adjusted threshold-response function for the case of informative
      outcome missingness, which utilizes machine learning and targeted minimum-loss
      estimation (TMLE). We prove the estimator is efficient and characterize its
      asymptotic distribution and robustness properties. Construction of simultaneous
      95% confidence bands for the threshold-specific estimand across a set of
      thresholds is discussed. In the Supporting Information, we discuss how to adjust 
      our estimator when the biomarker is missing at random, as occurs in clinical
      trials with biased sampling designs, using inverse probability weighting.
      Efficiency and bias reduction of the proposed estimator are assessed in
      simulations. The methods are employed to estimate neutralizing antibody
      thresholds for virologically confirmed dengue risk in the CYD14 and CYD15 dengue 
      vaccine trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti is currently controlled with synthetic larvicides;
      however, mosquitoes have become highly resistant to these larvicides and
      difficult to eradicate. Studies have shown that insecticides derived from fungal 
      extracts have various mechanisms of action that reduce the risk of resistance in 
      these mosquitoes. One possible mechanism is uncontrolled production of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) in the larvae, which can cause changes at the cellular
      level. Thus, the crude extract of Xylaria sp. was evaluated to investigate the
      oxidative effect of this extract in A. aegypti larvae by quantifying the
      oxidative damage to proteins and lipids. METHODS: The larvicidal potential of the
      crude extract of Xylaria sp. Was evaluated, and the extract was subsequently
      tested in human lung fibroblasts for cytotoxicity and ROS production. ROS level
      was quantified in the larvae that were killed following exposure to the extract
      in the larvicide test. RESULTS: The crude extract of Xylaria sp. Caused
      cytotoxicity and induced ROS production in human lung fibroblasts and A. aegypti 
      larvae, respectively. In the larvicide trial, the extract showed an LC50 of
      264.456 ppm and an LC90 of 364.307 ppm, and was thus considered active. The
      extract showed greater oxidative damage to lipids and proteins, with LC90 values 
      of 24.7 micromol MDA/L and 14.6278 x10-3 nmol carbonyl/ mg protein, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Crude extracts of Xylaria sp. induced oxidative stress that may have
      caused the mortality of A. aegypti larvae.

AB  - Dengue is caused by an arbovirus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family and
      there are four distinct, but close related, circulating serotypes. Dengue disease
      is of great importance for global public health, with vaccination being its main 
      prophylactic measure. However, there is a paucity of biological models for
      evaluating tetravalent dengue vaccines. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      susceptibility of human cell lines HEK293T and THP-1 to a commercial dengue
      vaccine and test the feasibility of this approach in the development of a potency
      assay with human cell lines, as a methodological alternative to the golden
      standard potency assay with VERO cells. In this context, we used a batch of the
      commercial vaccine Dengvaxia(R) (CYD-TDV) for the infection tests. We evaluated
      the presence of the vaccine virus in THP-1 cells, differentiated into macrophages
      (dTHP-1), and in HEK293T by confocal microscopy, using 4G2 pan-flavivirus
      antibody. Vaccine infectivity and potency were determined by immunocolorimetric
      assay using monoclonal antibodies specific for each serotype. The results
      indicated that the human strain HEK293T was responsive to the tetravalent
      vaccine, as shown by the presence of virus particles in the cell cytoplasm in a
      pattern similar to the one observed with VERO cells. Moreover, it was possible to
      determine the infectivity and potency values of each vaccine virus serotype in
      the HEK293T, with serotype 4 prevailing over the others. Thus, the human cell
      line HEK293T provides a potential candidate to be used in assays to determine
      potency and identity of tetravalent dengue vaccines.

TI  - Computational design of immunogenic peptide constructs comprising multiple human 
      leukocyte antigen restricted dengue virus envelope epitopes.
PG  - e2961
LID - 10.1002/jmr.2961 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is endemic in 100 countries with the ability to impact nearly
      50% of world population. DENV envelope (E) protein is responsible for viral
      attachment to host cells and has been target of various countermeasure
      development efforts. The current study focuses on a consensus computational
      approach to identify cross-reactive, immunogenic DENV-2 E peptides displaying
      promiscuity with a wide array of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. Four
      conserved peptides (FP-1, FP-2, FP-3 and FP-4) containing multiple CD8(+) and
      CD4(+) T cell epitopes were identified by employment of various immunoinformatics
      tools. FP-1, FP-2, FP-3 and FP-4 were estimated to bind with 227, 1787, 1008 and 
      834 HLA alleles, respectively. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) values obtained 
      by molecular docking (CABS-Dock) with 20 HLA alleles (10 each of HLA classes I
      and II) resulted into comparable RMSD values of identified epitopes with native
      peptides, which represents the natural presentation of epitopes to HLA molecules.
      These peptides were also found to be part of previous experimentally validated
      immunogenic peptides. Further, a dengue immunogenic peptide construct was
      generated by linking the four peptides, an adjuvant and a 6x histidine tag. The
      construct showed strong binding and stability with Toll-like receptor.
      Collectively, these results provide strong evidence in the support of the
      immunogenic potential of the dengue immunogenic peptide construct.

TI  - Urban Scaling of Health Outcomes: a Scoping Review.
PG  - 409-426
LID - 10.1007/s11524-021-00577-4 [doi]
AB  - Urban scaling is a framework that describes how city-level characteristics scale 
      with variations in city size. This scoping review mapped the existing evidence on
      the urban scaling of health outcomes to identify gaps and inform future research.
      Using a structured search strategy, we identified and reviewed a total of 102
      studies, a majority set in high-income countries using diverse city definitions. 
      We found several historical studies that examined the dynamic relationships
      between city size and mortality occurring during the nineteenth and early
      twentieth centuries. In more recent years, we documented heterogeneity in the
      relation between city size and health. Measles and influenza are influenced by
      city size in conjunction with other factors like geographic proximity, while
      STIs, HIV, and dengue tend to occur more frequently in larger cities. NCDs showed
      a heterogeneous pattern that depends on the specific outcome and context.
      Homicides and other crimes are more common in larger cities, suicides are more
      common in smaller cities, and traffic-related injuries show a less clear pattern 
      that differs by context and type of injury. Future research should aim to
      understand the consequences of urban growth on health outcomes in low- and
      middle-income countries, capitalize on longitudinal designs, systematically
      adjust for covariates, and examine the implications of using different city
      definitions.

      have been increasing steadily in the past decades causing millions of deaths
      every year. So far, there is no vaccine that works effectively on all serotypes. 
      Recently, CpG-recoded vaccines have proved to be effective against few viruses.
      METHODS: In this study, evaluation and interpretation of more than 4547 Dengue
      virus genome sequences were included for analyzing novel CpG dinucleotides rich
      regions which are shared amid all serotypes. Genomic regions of DENV were
      synonymously CpG recoded using in silico methods and analyzed for adaptation in
      both human and Aedes spp. hosts based on CAI scores. RESULTS: The analysis
      mirrored that serotypes 1, 3, and 4 shared CpG islands present in common regions.
      DENV-2 CpG islands showed no similarity with any of the CpG islands present in
      other serotypes. While DENV-3 sequences were found to possess the maximum number 
      of conserved CpG islands stretches; DENV-2 was found to possess the lowest
      number. We found that all serotypes (with an exception of serotype 2) have CpG
      island in their 3' UTR. In silico CpG recoding of DENV genomic regions resulted
      in approximately 3 fold increase of CpG dinucleotide frequency and comparative
      analysis based on CAI scores showed decreased adaptive fitness of CpG recoded
      DENV inside human host. CONCLUSION: These CG-dinucleotide-enriched RNA sequences 
      can be targeted by ZAP (zinc-finger antiviral protein) which can differentiate
      between host mRNA and viral mRNA. Our in silico findings can further be exploited
      for CpG-recoding of DENV genomes which can evoke cellular and humoral immune
      responses by recruiting ZAP-induced RNA degradation machinery and hence providing
      a promising approach for vaccine development.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dengue infection is a significant public health concern that no
      specific treatment is available. Extracorporeal plasmapheresis or plasma
      filtration is a treatment option for severe cases with complications. However,
      the commercial adsorption devices mainly contained size-exclusive porous beads to
      adsorb the plasma proteins nonselectively. METHODS: We developed a 1:50 simulated
      circuit for dengue virus-specific adsorption using a flavivirus-specific (4G2)
      antibody entrapped into the alginate bead. RESULTS: The reduction ratios of the
      viral titer after 3 h of continuous run were 63.00 +/- 1.21%, and 93.97 +/- 1.27%
      measured by reverse transcription qPCR, and plaque titration, respectively. No
      specific adsorption was observed with Enterovirus A71 or Escherichia coli
      bacteria. CONCLUSION: This study is a proof-of-concept for the potential use of a
      dengue virus-specific adsorption column in the 1:50 simulated circuit. The system
      could be applied to various clinical platforms by substituting target-specific
      antibodies.

TI  - Vitamin D-induced LL-37 modulates innate immune responses of human primary
      macrophages during DENV-2 infection.
LID - ftac014 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femspd/ftac014 [doi]
AB  - Epidemics of dengue, an acute and potentially severe disease caused by
      mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV), pose a major challenge to clinicians and
      health care services across the sub(tropics). Severe disease onset is associated 
      with a dysregulated inflammatory response to the virus, and there are currently
      no drugs to alleviate disease symptoms. LL-37 is a potent antimicrobial peptide
      with a wide range of immunoregulatory properties. In this study, we assessed the 
      effect of LL-37 on DENV-2-induced responses in human monocyte-derived macrophages
      (MDMs). We show that simultaneous exposure of exogenous LL-37 and DENV-2 resulted
      in reduced replication of the virus in MDMs, while the addition of LL-37
      postexposure to DENV-2 did not. Interestingly, the latter condition reduced the
      production of IL-6 and increased the expression of genes involved in virus
      sensing and antiviral response. Finally, we demonstrate that low endogenous
      levels and limited production of LL-37 in MDMs in response to DENV-2 infection
      can be increased by differentiating MDMs in the presence of Vitamin D (VitD3).
      Taken together, this study demonstrates that in addition to its antimicrobial
      properties, LL-37 has immunomodulatory properties in the curse of DENV infection 
      and its production can be increased by VitD3.

      Kamphaeng Phet province, Thailand.

LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac177 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) often circulates endemically. In such settings with high
      levels of transmission, it remains unclear whether there are risk factors that
      alter individual infection risk. We tested blood taken from individuals living in
      multigenerational households in Kamphaeng Phet province, Thailand for DENV
      antibodies (N = 2364, mean age 31y). Seropositivity ranged from 45.4% among those
      1-5y to 99.5% for those >30y. Using spatially explicit catalytic models, we
      estimated 11.8% of the susceptible population gets infected annually. We found
      37.5% of the variance in seropositivity was explained by unmeasured
      household-level effects with only 4.2% explained by spatial differences between
      households. The serostatus of individuals from the same household remained
      significantly correlated even when separated by up to 15 years in age. These
      findings show that despite highly endemic transmission, persistent differences in
      infection risk exist across households, the reasons for which remain unclear.

TI  - The innate immune response following multivalent dengue vaccination and
      implications for protection against dengue challenge.
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.157811 [doi]
LID - e157811 [pii]
AB  - Understanding the immune response to dengue virus (DENV) is essential for
      developing a dengue vaccine that is protective against all 4 DENV serotypes. We
      evaluated the immune response after vaccination (live attenuated tetravalent
      dengue vaccine TV005 or trivalent admixture) and after challenge with DEN2Delta30
      (Tonga/74) to better understand the importance of homotypic immunity in vaccine
      protection. Significant increases in IP-10 expression were observed following
      receipt of either the trivalent or tetravalent vaccine. After challenge, a large 
      increase in IP-10 expression was observed in the placebo and trivalent admixture 
      groups but not in the tetravalent vaccine group. MCP-1, IL-1RA, and MIP-1beta
      exhibited a similar pattern as IP-10. These results demonstrate protective
      effects of trivalent and tetravalent vaccines against DENV and suggest that the
      tetravalent vaccine has a better protective effect compared with the trivalent
      admixture. We also explored the postvaccination and postchallenge immune response
      differences between Black and White participants. White participants responded to
      vaccine differently than Black participants; Black participants receiving
      trivalent and tetravalent vaccines responded strongly and White participants
      responded only transiently in trivalent group. In response to challenge, White
      participants elicited a stronger response than Black participants. These results 
      may explain why White participants may have a more vigorous DENV immune response 
      than Black participants, as reported in literature.

      Clinicolaboratory profile of children admitted with MIS-C and dengue were
      compared to understand their presentation at the outset. METHODS: This was a
      retrospective study of children </= 12 y admitted with MIS-C (WHO definition) or 
      laboratory-confirmed dengue between August 2020 and January 2021 at a tertiary
      center in North India. RESULTS: A total of 84 children (MIS-C - 40; dengue - 44) 
      were included. The mean (SD) age [83.5 (39) vs. 91.6 (35) mo] was comparable.
      Rash (72.5% vs. 22.7%), conjunctival injection (60% vs. 2.3%), oral mucocutaneous
      changes (27.5% vs. 0) and gallop rhythm (15% vs. 0) were seen more frequently
      with MIS-C, while petechiae [29.5% vs. 7.5%], myalgia (38.6% vs. 10%), headache
      (22.7% vs. 2.5%), and hepatomegaly (68.2% vs. 27.5%) were more common with
      dengue. Children with MIS-C had significantly higher C-reactive protein (124 vs. 
      3.2 mg/L) and interleukin 6 (95.3 vs. 20.7 ng/mL), while those with dengue had
      higher hemoglobin (12 vs. 10.2 g/dL) lower mean platelet count (26 vs. 140 x
      10(9)/L), and greater elevation in aspartate (607 vs. 44 IU/L) and alanine (235.5
      vs. 56 IU/L) aminotransferases. The hospital stay was longer with MIS-C; however,
      PICU stay and mortality were comparable. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized children
      with acute febrile illness, the presence of mucocutaneous features and highly
      elevated CRP could distinguish MIS-C from dengue. The presence of petechiae,
      hepatomegaly, and hemoconcentration may favor a diagnosis of dengue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated clinical and laboratory findings among patients with
      non-severe or severe dengue in Puerto Rico to examine whether clinical
      manifestations vary by age. METHODS: During 2012-2014, we enrolled patients who
      arrived at the emergency department with fever or history of fever within 7 days 
      of presentation. Serum samples were tested for dengue virus (DENV) by RT-PCR and 
      IgM ELISA. Severe dengue was defined as severe plasma leakage or shock, severe
      bleeding, or organ involvement at presentation, during hospitalization, or
      follow-up. RESULTS: Of 1089 dengue patients identified, 281 (26%) were severe.
      Compared to those with non-severe dengue, patients with severe dengue were more
      often aged 10-19 years (55% vs. 40%, p < 0.001) and hospitalized (87% vs. 30%, p 
      < 0.001). Severe plasma leakage or shock was more common among children aged 0-9 
      (59%) or 10-19 years (86%) than adults (49%) (p < 0.01). Severe bleeding was less
      common among 10-19 year-olds (24%) compared to 0-9 year-olds (45%) and adults
      (52%; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Severe plasma leakage was the most common
      presentation among children, highlighting important differences with adults.
      Vaccination against dengue could help prevent severe dengue among children in
      Puerto Rico.

AB  - Dengue (DENV), Zica virus (ZIKV), and Chikungunya fever (CHIK) are tropical
      diseases that have caused a lot of problems in general worldwide. Transmitted by 
      mosquitoes of the species Aedes aegypti and albopictus, they have not been
      completely eradicated in the country, and their proliferation has only increased 
      in the Northeast region. Within the structure of the virus, it is possible to
      verify the presence of glycoprotein SN1, which is responsible for its
      replication. If this macromolecule is inhibited using a specific or complex
      linker, it can interrupt its replication activity. An alternative to this problem
      has been using structures derived from natural products that have pharmacological
      properties. A dynamic and molecular docking combined study used computational
      simulation in the four isomeric forms of bixin against the SN1 protein. The
      Z,E-bixin and E,E-bixin isomers, both with affinity energy -6.7 and -6.5
      Kcal/mol, presented the best results. Thus, bixin and its isomers, found in
      annatto seeds, maybe an initial proposal in the search for prototype compounds to
      study to fight this lethal virus in the future.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

TI  - Secondary cross infection with dengue virus serotype 2/3 aggravates vascular
      leakage in BALB/c mice.
PG  - 4338-4347
LID - 10.1002/jmv.27826 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) has occasionally emerged at epidemic levels in Yunnan, China.
      Vaccine development is limited by antibody-dependent enhancement and a lack of
      good animal models. Thus, the study investigated cross infection based on
      maternal immunity in BALB/c mice and assessed the risk of cross infection by
      DV2-D13113 and DV3-YNWS2 epidemic virus strains. DV replicated within the organs 
      of the BALB/c infant mice, even causing death. Particularly, DV3-infected infant 
      mice were at higher risk of severe disease if their mothers were infected with
      DV2. Although BALB/c adults and pups survived DV2/DV3 infection and produced
      anti-DV antibodies after 5-8 days, extensive subcutaneous vascular leakage was
      observed after secondary DV infection. Furthermore, vascular permeability in the 
      lung and kidney significantly increased in offspring born to heterotypic
      virus-infected mothers. Thus, vascular leakage indicates severe DV infection. The
      results indicate that maternal immunity increases the severity of subsequent
      heterotypic infection. Additionally, secondary cross infection by D13113 and
      YNWS2 represents a risk of serious disease. This study has implications for
      studies of DV cross infection and vaccine development.

PG  - e2360
LID - 10.1002/rmv.2360 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes frequent outbreaks
      in tropical countries. Due to the four different serotypes and ever-mutating RNA 
      genome, it is challenging to develop efficient therapeutics. Early diagnosis is
      crucial to prevent the severe form of dengue, leading to mortality. In the past
      decade, rapid advancement in the high throughput sequencing technologies has shed
      light on the crucial regulating role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), also known as
      the "dark matter" of the genome, in various pathological processes. In addition
      to the human host ncRNAs like microRNAs and circular RNAs, DENV also produces
      ncRNAs such as subgenomic flaviviral RNAs that can modulate the virus life cycle 
      and regulate disease outcomes. This review outlines the advances in understanding
      the interplay between the human host and DENV ncRNAs, their regulation of the
      innate immune system of the host, and the prospects of the ncRNAs in clinical
      applications such as dengue diagnosis and promising therapeutics.

AB  - While no vaccine is on the horizon to prevent traveler's diarrhea, progress has
      been made in the field of malaria and dengue fever. In both cases, the objective 
      is not primarily the prevention among travelers but rather the reduction of
      morbidity and mortality in populations living in endemic areas. The immune
      mechanisms protecting against parasitosis are not well understood, which further 
      complicates vaccine development. The fact that veterinary vaccines against the
      parasites causing cysticercosis and echinococcosis are available for animals,
      justifies a certain optimism that vaccines against parasitosis will also be
      available for humans in the future. We report on recent developments in dengue,
      malaria, schistosomiasis, and hookworm vaccines.

      case report.
PG  - 49-52
LID - 10.29390/cjrt-2021-028 [doi]
AB  - Background: Late diagnosis of COVID-19 in young patients in a hypercoagulable
      state can cause a high mortality rate. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19
      include respiratory and extrapulmonary symptoms such as a hypercoagulable state, 
      increased transaminase enzymes, and multiple-organ failure. Case and outcomes: A 
      34-year-old male presented to the emergency room after 3 days of high fever,
      weakness, and flatulence. The patient had thrombocytopenia and elevated liver
      transaminase enzymes and was initially diagnosed with dengue hemorrhagic fever.
      He was given hydration intravenous fluids, oxygen, antipyretic, and
      hepatoprotector. On day 4, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and received
      therapy to decrease the Alanine transaminase and Aspartate transaminase levels.
      While waiting for outsourced D dimer and prothrombin time results, the patient
      was given low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on day 5. On day 13, his condition 
      deteriorated with cephalgia and shortness of breath, but the patient's family
      refused intubation. The chest CT scan revealed large ground-glass opacities in
      both lungs. The patient was given additional medications, such as Meropenem,
      Dexamethasone, and Remdesivir. On day 15, the patient passed away. Discussion:
      Intermediate LMWH dosage seems to be associated with a lower mortality incidence 
      than standard Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19
      patients. However, due to the late COVID-19 diagnosis, the patient was not given 
      LMWH at the beginning of treatment. Conclusion: A hypercoagulable state is partly
      responsible for the high mortality rate of COVID-19 patients. Early detection and
      management of the hypercoagulable state, including the use of LMWH, can decrease 
      the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.

TI  - Oroxylin A shows limited antiviral activity towards dengue virus.
PG  - 154
LID - 10.1186/s13104-022-06040-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The mosquito transmitted dengue virus (DENV) the causative agent of
      dengue fever (DF) remains a significant public health burden in many countries.
      Thailand, along with many countries in Asia and elsewhere, has a long history of 
      using traditional medicines to combat febrile diseases such as DF. Screening
      bioactive compounds from traditional medicines reported to have antipyretic or
      anti-inflammatory activity may lead to the development of potent antivirals. In
      this study oroxylin A (OA), a flavonoid derivative found in Oroxylum indicum
      (commonly called the Indian trumpet flower or tree of Damocles), was screened for
      antiviral activity towards DENV. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity analysis in BHK-21 cells
      showed a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 534.17 microM. The compound showed
      no direct virucidal activity towards DENV, and pre-treatment of cells had no
      effect on virus production. A deficit was seen in virus production when cells
      were post-infection treated with oroxylin A. Under conditions of post-infection
      treatment, the EC50 value was 201.1 microM, giving a selectivity index (SI) value
      of 2.66. Accumulation of DENV E protein inside the cell was seen under conditions
      of post-infection treatment, suggesting that oroxylin A may exert some effects at
      the virus assembly/egress stages of the replication cycle.

AB  - The historical number of yearly deaths in Brazil has a growing tendency since
      always. In recent years were observed increases in this number beyond the
      tendency, probably associated to epidemics. In this work it was implemented an
      analysis on public data, using the total number of deaths from violence,
      respiratory diseases, and deaths in hospitals. The historical series of deaths in
      Brazil from 2003 to 2019 was used to estimate the number of deaths in 2020 by a
      statistical projection, and this estimate value was compared with the number of
      deaths recorded as "Deaths with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19". It was
      verified that deaths attributed to COVID-19 far exceed the statistical
      projections but this result was interpreted together with the numbers of deaths
      by respiratory diseases. Increasing of deaths between 2019 and 2020 can be
      partially explained by a lowering in the deaths of violence in 2019. In this
      paper it was verified that despite de pandemic the difference between number of
      deaths between 2020 and 2019 remained in the same order of magnitude as the
      difference in the past, in periods which can be associated to other infectious
      diseases as H1N1 and dengue, for example.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: SARS-CoV-2 infection typically presents with fever and respiratory
      symptoms. Besides this, COVID-19 related central and peripheral nervous system
      manifestations are emerging. OBJECTIVES: This study summarises the demographics, 
      clinical profile, laboratory findings, management strategies, and outcomes in a
      large number of patients with COVID-19 related GBS and its variants. We also
      compared its clinical profile with Zika and dengue virus-related GBS. METHODS:
      Authors carried out a literature search up to Dec 31, 2020, in MEDLINE, PubMed,
      SCOPUS, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar for all published articles.
      RESULTS: The study identified 54 different types of articles consisting of 70
      cases from 17 countries worldwide. Maximum cases 15 (21.4%) were identified from 
      Italy, followed by USA 12 (17.1%), Spain 11 (15.7%), and Iran 10 (14.3%). The age
      group more than 60 years had most cases with 32 (45.7%) cases followed by age
      group 40-60 with cases 25 (35.7%) with male and female ratio 2. Maximum cases
      were treated with IVIG infusion 58 (82.9%), followed by Plasma exchange 13
      (18.6%) cases. Out of 70 cases, 7 (10%) cases were manifested as Miller-Fisher
      syndrome. The most predominant electrodiagnostic variant was demyelinating
      neuropathy in 41 (73.21%) cases. The outcome reported in 67 cases was survival in
      63 (90%) cases and the death of 4 (5.7%) cases. CONCLUSION: Covid 19 related GBS 
      were reported worldwide with a better outcome. Both postinfectious or
      parainfectious patterns were reported. Early recognition with prompt management
      of GBS can prevent further severe morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Combining rapid diagnostic tests to estimate primary and post-primary dengue
      immune status at the point of care.
PG  - e0010365
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Characterising dengue virus (DENV) infection history at the point of 
      care is challenging as it relies on intensive laboratory techniques. We
      investigated how combining different rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can be used to
      accurately determine the primary and post-primary DENV immune status of reporting
      patients during diagnosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Serum from cross-sectional
      surveys of acute suspected dengue patients in Indonesia (N:200) and Vietnam (N:
      1,217) were assayed using dengue laboratory assays and RDTs. Using logistic
      regression modelling, we determined the probability of being DENV NS1, IgM and
      IgG RDT positive according to corresponding laboratory viremia, IgM and IgG ELISA
      metrics. Laboratory test thresholds for RDT positivity/negativity were calculated
      using Youden's J index and were utilized to estimate the RDT outcomes in patients
      from the Philippines, where only data for viremia, IgM and IgG were available
      (N:28,326). Lastly, the probabilities of being primary or post-primary according 
      to every outcome using all RDTs, by day of fever, were calculated. Combining NS1,
      IgM and IgG RDTs captured 94.6% (52/55) and 95.4% (104/109) of
      laboratory-confirmed primary and post-primary DENV cases, respectively, during
      the first 5 days of fever. Laboratory test predicted, and actual, RDT outcomes
      had high agreement (79.5% (159/200)). Among patients from the Philippines,
      different combinations of estimated RDT outcomes were indicative of post-primary 
      and primary immune status. Overall, IgG RDT positive results were confirmatory of
      post-primary infections. In contrast, IgG RDT negative results were suggestive of
      both primary and post-primary infections on days 1-2 of fever, yet were
      confirmatory of primary infections on days 3-5 of fever. CONCLUSION: We
      demonstrate how the primary and post-primary DENV immune status of reporting
      patients can be estimated at the point of care by combining NS1, IgM and IgG RDTs
      and considering the days since symptoms onset. This framework has the potential
      to strengthen surveillance operations and dengue prognosis, particularly in low
      resource settings.

TI  - Simple clinical and laboratory predictors to improve empirical treatment
      strategies in areas of high scrub typhus and dengue endemicity, central Vietnam.
PG  - e0010281
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010281 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is highly endemic in Vietnam, but scrub typhus-although 
      recognized as an endemic disease-remains underappreciated. These diseases
      together are likely to account for more than half of the acute undifferentiated
      fever burden in Vietnam. Scrub typhus (ST) is a bacterial disease requiring
      antimicrobial treatment, while dengue fever (DF) is of viral etiology and does
      not. The access to adequate diagnostics and the current understanding of
      empirical treatment strategies for both illnesses remain limited. In this study
      we aimed to contribute to the clinical decision process in the management of
      these two important etiologies of febrile illness in Vietnam. METHODS: Using
      retrospective data from 221 PCR-confirmed scrub typhus cases and 387 NS1 protein 
      positive dengue fever patients admitted to five hospitals in Khanh Hoa province
      (central Vietnam), we defined predictive characteristics for both diseases that
      support simple clinical decision making with potential to inform decision
      algorithms in future. We developed models to discriminate scrub typhus from
      dengue fever using multivariable logistic regression (M-LR) and classification
      and regression trees (CART). Regression trees were developed for the entire data 
      set initially and pruned, based on cross-validation. Regression models were
      developed in a training data set involving 60% of the total sample and validated 
      in the complementary subsample. Probability cut points for the distinction
      between scrub typhus and dengue fever were chosen to maximise the sum of
      sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Using M-LR, following seven predictors were
      identified, that reliably differentiate ST from DF; eschar, regional
      lymphadenopathy, an occupation in nature, increased days of fever on admission,
      increased neutrophil count, decreased ratio of neutrophils/lymphocytes, and age
      over 40. Sensitivity and specificity of predictions based on these seven factors 
      reached 93.7% and 99.5%, respectively. When excluding the "eschar" variable, the 
      values dropped to 76.3% and 92.3%, respectively. The CART model generated one
      further variable; increased days of fever on admission, when eschar was included,
      the sensitivity and specificity was 95% and 96.9%, respectively. The model
      without eschar involved the following six variables; regional lymphadenopathy,
      increased days of fever on admission, increased neutrophil count, increased
      lymphocyte count, platelet count >/= 47 G/L and age over 28 years as predictors
      of ST and provided a sensitivity of 77.4% and a specificity of 90.7%.
      CONCLUSIONS: The generated algorithms contribute to differentiating scrub typhus 
      from dengue fever using basic clinical and laboratory parameters, supporting
      clinical decision making in areas where dengue and scrub typhus are co-endemic in
      Vietnam.

TI  - Possible Routes for Zika Virus Vertical Transmission in Human Placenta: A
      Comprehensive Review.
LID - 10.1089/vim.2021.0199 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have gained notoriety due to congenital
      abnormalities. Pregnant women have a greater risk of ZIKV infection and
      consequent transmission to their progeny due to the immunological changes
      associated with pregnancy. ZIKV has been detected in amniotic fluid, as well as
      in fetal and neonatal tissues of infected pregnant women. However, the mechanism 
      by which ZIKV reaches the fetus is not well understood. The four dengue virus
      serotypes have been the most widely used flaviviruses to elucidate the host-cell 
      entry pathways. Nevertheless, it is of increasing interest to understand the
      specific interaction between ZIKV and the host cell, especially in the gestation 
      period. Herein, the authors describe the mechanisms of prenatal vertical
      infection of ZIKV based on results from in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo studies,
      including murine models and nonhuman primates. It also includes up-to-date
      knowledge from ex vivo and natural infections in pregnant women explaining the
      vertical transmission along four tracks: transplacental, paracellular,
      transcytosis mediated by extracellular vesicles, and paraplacental route and the 
      antibody-dependent enhancement process. A global understanding of the diverse
      pathways used by ZIKV to cross the placental barrier and access the fetus, along 
      with a better comprehension of the pathogenesis of ZIKV in pregnant females, may 
      constitute a fundamental role in the design of antiviral drugs to reduce
      congenital disabilities associated with ZIKV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zoonoses are diseases transmitted from an animal host to humans or
      vice versa. In Chile, the zoonoses of mandatory notification are brucellosis,
      anthrax, trichinosis, hydatidosis, leptospirosis, dengue, Chagas disease,
      hantavirosis and rabies. AIM: To assess the trend and characterize the mortality 
      from zoonoses of mandatory notification in Chile between 1997-2018. METHODS: An
      official mortality and population data were used. Relative, general and specific 
      mortality rates were described according to sociodemographic variables. Crude and
      adjusted annual mortality rates (direct method) were calculated. Temporal trend
      was evaluated with the Prais-Winsten regression model. RESULTS: Between 1997 and 
      2018, the mortality rate due to zoonosis of mandatory notification corresponded
      to 0.13% (2152 deaths) of the total mortality, being Chagas disease (59.2%),
      hydatidosis (24.6%) and hantavirosis (13.5%) the main causes. The general
      adjusted mortality rate decreased significantly (B: -0.017; IC95%: -0.024;
      -0.009) as did hydatidosis (B: -0.011; IC95%: -0.013; -0.008), and only
      hantavirosis showed an increase trend (not significant). CONCLUSION: Mortality
      due to zoonoses decreased during the period; only hantavirosis showed an
      increasing trend. It is suggested to focus on strategies to prevent contagion and
      mortality by hantavirosis, as well as to improve access to treatment for the
      other zoonoses.

TI  - A cross-sectional survey to evaluate prescribers' knowledge and understanding of 
      safety messages following Dengvaxia(R) product information update.
PG  - 758-768
LID - 10.1002/pds.5447 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the effectiveness of additional risk minimisation measures 
      (aRMMs; i.e., educational materials) distributed to prescribers to ensure that
      only individuals with evidence of prior dengue infection (PDI, i.e., dengue
      seropositive) would be vaccinated with the tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV;
      Dengvaxia(R)). METHODS: A survey was conducted in 2020 among 300 CYD-TDV
      prescribers in Brazil and Thailand to ascertain three success criteria:
      prescribers' awareness of the materials (receiving and reading them); knowledge
      of the key messages; and whether their self-reported behaviour regarding
      practice-related scenarios was aligned with the updated guidance. RESULTS: The
      aRMMs were not generally effective as <80% of prescribers in both countries met
      two of the three predefined success criteria. In Brazil, 98.7% were aware of the 
      aRMMs whereas in Thailand this criterion was fulfilled by 74.0%. Almost all
      prescribers knew that CYD-TDV was recommended only in individuals with PDI (98.7%
      and 96.7% in Brazil and Thailand, respectively). In Brazil, where vaccination was
      restricted to those with a documented history of PDI, 11.3% considered that
      confirmation should be done through a blood test. More than 75% in both countries
      considered additional signs of dengue, as early warning signs, and not only those
      regarded as such by the 2009 WHO guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not
      support that the aRMMs were effective as the predefined success criteria were not
      met. The use of reliable rapid diagnosis tests together with the revised
      prescribing information and educational materials will facilitate the
      implementation and compliance with pre-vaccination screening for CYD-TDV
      eligibility.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of knockdown resistance mutations in the dengue vector
      Aedes albopictus in Guangzhou, China.
PG  - 156
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05241-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The city of Guangzhou has been the epicenter of dengue fever in China
      since the 1990s, with Aedes albopictus being the primary vector. The main method 
      used to control vectors and prevent dengue fever has been the application of
      chemical insecticides; however, this control strategy has resulted in the
      development of resistance to these insecticides in mosquitoes. Here we report our
      investigation of the patterns of knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in 15 field
      populations of Ae. albopictus collected from 11 districts in Guangzhou. RESULTS: 
      Four mutant alleles (V1016G, F1534S, F1534C, F1534L) were detected in domain II
      and III of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene. Various allele
      frequencies of kdr mutations were observed (3.1-25.9% for V1016G, 22.6-85.5% for 
      F1534S, 0-29.0% for F1534L, 0.6-54.2% for F1534C). Seven kdr haplotypes (VF, VS, 
      VL, VC, GF, GC, GS) were identified; the highest frequency of haplotypes was
      found for the single mutant haplotype VS (50.8%), followed by the wild-type VF
      haplotype (21.7%) and the single mutant haplotype VC (11.9%). Of the three double
      mutant haplotypes, GF was the most frequent (8.8%), followed by GC (1.2%) and GS 
      (0.8%). Aedes albopictus showed spatial heterogeneity in deltamethrin resistance 
      in populations collected in Guangzhou. We also observed significant differences
      in haplotype frequency. The frequency of the VC haplotype was significantly
      higher in high-risk dengue areas than in low-risk ones. CONCLUSIONS: The kdr
      allele V1016G was discovered for the first time in Guangzhou. Genetic isolation
      in mosquito populations and long-term insecticide selection seem to be
      responsible for the persistent, patchy distribution of kdr mutant alleles. The
      small-scale spatial heterogeneity in the distribution and frequency of kdr
      mutations may have important implications for vector control operations and
      insecticide resistance management strategies.

TI  - Telemedicine medical evaluation of low-risk patients with dengue during an
      outbreak may be an option in reducing the need for on-site physicians.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effectiveness of telemedicine consultations during an
      outbreak in reducing the need for face-to-face consultations at a field hospital 
      for patients with dengue. METHODS: We performed a retrospective unicentric study 
      between April and May 2015 with 4626 patients (>/=15 years old) who spontaneously
      sought care at an emergency field hospital (Sao Paulo/Brazil). A nurse initially 
      assessed all patients with dengue through rapid diagnostic testing, automated
      complete blood count, and risk stratification. During overcrowded situations, a
      video-based telemedicine consultation was provided as an option to all
      low-to-moderate risk patients who tested positive. The management was carried out
      according to current dengue guidelines. The primary end point was a referral to
      immediate face-to-face medical evaluation. RESULTS: Of all patients suspected of 
      dengue infection, 2003 presented positive testing, 1978 were classified as
      low-moderate risk, and 267 patients with dengue were evaluated by telemedicine.
      The mean age was 38.17 +/- 13.7 years (54.6% female). Oral medications were
      recommended in 169 (63.3%), intravenous hydration or symptomatic drugs in 96
      (36%), 252 (94.4%) were discharged after telemedicine assessment, and only 15
      (5.6%) were referred to immediate face-to-face medical evaluation. No adverse
      events were recorded. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine medical assessment of
      low-to-moderate risk patients with dengue previously screened by nursing triage
      is effective in replacing the face-to-face evaluation in a field hospital.
      Telemedicine may be reinforced in epidemiological outbreak scenarios as a
      cost-effective strategy for the initial assessment of acute patients.

TI  - Beneath the surface: Amino acid variation underlying two decades of dengue virus 
      antigenic dynamics in Bangkok, Thailand.
PG  - e1010500
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010500 [doi]
AB  - Neutralizing antibodies are important correlates of protection against dengue.
      Yet, determinants of variation in neutralization across strains within the four
      dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) is imperfectly understood. Studies focus on
      structural DENV proteins, especially the envelope (E), the primary target of
      anti-DENV antibodies. Although changes in immune recognition (antigenicity) are
      often attributed to variation in epitope residues, viral processes influencing
      conformation and epitope accessibility also affect neutralizability, suggesting
      possible modulating roles of nonstructural proteins. We estimated effects of
      residue changes in all 10 DENV proteins on antigenic distances between 348 DENV
      collected from individuals living in Bangkok, Thailand (1994-2014). Antigenic
      distances were derived from response of each virus to a panel of twenty non-human
      primate antisera. Across 100 estimations, excluding 10% of virus pairs each time,
      77 of 295 positions with residue variability in E consistently conferred
      antigenic effects; 52 were within +/-3 sites of known binding sites of
      neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies, exceeding expectations from random
      assignments of effects to sites (p = 0.037). Effects were also identified for 16 
      sites on the stem/anchor of E which were only recently shown to become exposed
      under physiological conditions. For all proteins, except nonstructural protein 2A
      (NS2A), root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) in predicting distances between pairs held
      out in each estimation did not outperform sequences of equal length derived from 
      all proteins or E, suggesting that antigenic signals present were likely through 
      linkage with E. Adjusted for E, we identified 62/219 sites embedding the excess
      signals in NS2A. Concatenating these sites to E additionally explained 3.4% to
      4.0% of observed variance in antigenic distances compared to E alone (50.5% to
      50.8%); RMSE outperformed concatenating E with sites from any protein of the
      virus (DeltaRMSE, 95%IQR: 0.01, 0.05). Our results support examining antigenic
      determinants beyond the DENV surface.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent increase in dengue virus (DENV) outbreaks and the absence 
      of an effective vaccine have highlighted the importance of developing rapid and
      effective diagnostic surveillance tests and mosquito-based screening programs. To
      establish effective control measures for preventing future DENV transmission, the
      present study was established to identify the main mosquito vector involved in
      the dengue fever (DF) outbreak in Upper Egypt in 2016 and detect the diversity of
      dengue virus serotypes circulating in both humans and vectors. METHODS: We
      investigated the prevalence of DENV infection and circulating serotypes in the
      sera of 51 humans clinically suspected of DF and 1800 field-collected Aedes
      aegypti adult female mosquitoes grouped into 36 pooled samples. Both DENV
      non-structural protein (NS1) immunochromatographic strip assay and loop-mediated 
      isothermal amplification (LAMP) were used for screening. RESULTS: Overall, the
      rate of DENV infection in both human sera and pooled mosquito homogenate was
      33.3%, as revealed by rapid dipstick immunochromatographic analysis. However,
      higher detection rates were observed with RT-LAMP assay of 60.8% and 44.4% for
      humans and vector mosquitoes, respectively. DENV-1 was the most prevalent
      serotype in both populations. A combination of two, three, or even four
      circulating serotypes was found in 87.5% of total positive pooled mosquito
      samples and 83.87% of DENV-positive human sera. CONCLUSION: The study reinforces 
      the evidence of the reemergence of Aedes aegypti in Upper Egypt, inducing an
      outbreak of DENV. Mosquito-based surveillance of DENV infection is important to
      elucidate the viral activity rate and define serotype diversity to understand the
      virus dynamics in the reinfested area. Up to our knowledge, this is the first
      report of serotyping of DENV infection in an outbreak in Egypt using RT-LAMP
      assay.

TI  - LSPR based on-chip detection of dengue NS1 antigen in whole blood.
PG  - 33770-33780
LID - 10.1039/d1ra05009e [doi]
AB  - The development of a biosensor for rapid and quantitative detection of the dengue
      virus continues to remain a challenge. We report a lab-on-chip device that
      combines membrane-based blood plasma separation and a localized surface plasmon
      resonance (LSPR) based biosensor for on-chip detection of dengue NS1 antigen from
      a few drops of blood. The LSPR effect is realized by irradiating UV-NIR light
      having a spectral peak at 655 nm onto nanostructures fabricated via thermal
      annealing of a thin metal film. We study the effect of the resulting metal
      nanostructures on the LSPR performance in terms of sensitivity and limit of
      detection, by annealing silver films at temperatures ranging from 100 to 500
      degrees C. The effect of annealing temperature on the nanostructure size and
      uniformity and the resulting optical characteristics are investigated. Further,
      the binding between non-targeted blood plasma proteins and
      NS1-antibody-functionalized nanostructures on the LSPR performance is studied by 
      considering different blocking mechanisms. Using a nanostructure annealed at 200 
      degrees C and 2X-phosphate buffer saline with 0.05% Tween-20 as the blocking
      buffer, from 10 muL of whole blood, the device can detect NS1 antigen at a
      concentration as low as 0.047 mug mL(-1) within 30 min. Finally, we demonstrate
      the detection of NS1 in the blood samples of dengue-infected patients and
      validate our results with those obtained from the gold-standard ELISA test.

TI  - A study on maternal and foetal prognosis and predictive factors for adverse
      outcome in pregnant patients with dengue in an endemic state of India.
PG  - 912-917
LID - 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_633_21 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Dengue fever is a major health problem with high morbidity and mortality
      especially during epidemic season; pregnant females being no exception. But,
      there is paucity of published data on dengue fever during pregnancy. Hence, this 
      study was planned to study the clinical profile, maternal outcome and predictors 
      of poor outcome in pregnant dengue patients. Materials and Methods: All pregnant 
      females attending labour room of Tata Main Hospital, Jamshedpur from April 2016
      to October2020 with acute febrile illness caused by dengue virus at any
      gestational age were included in the study. Diagnosis of dengue was made by
      detection of NS1 antigen or dengue serology. A predesigned proforma was used to
      record materno-foetal outcomes and were analysed. Results: Dengue was the cause
      of fever in 7.1% febrile patients. Maternal complications included abortions
      (26%), abruptio (1.9%), postpartum haemorrhage (11.9%) . Of all the pregnant
      dengue patients, five had severe dengue(SD) with high mortality (3/5; 60%). Fetal
      complications were intrauterine death(7.7%),preterm(42.3%). Thrombocytopenia and 
      elevated transaminases were associated with adverse outcome. Conclusions: Dengue 
      fever in pregnancy is associated with poor outcomes more in cases of SD rather
      than dengue fever . Pregnant females with high risk predictors should be
      identified and managed aggressively in intensive care units to improve outcomes.

      counting.
PG  - e878
LID - 10.7717/peerj-cs.878 [doi]
AB  - The plaque assay is a standard quantification system in virology for verifying
      infectious particles. One of the complex steps of plaque assay is the counting of
      the number of viral plaques in multiwell plates to study and evaluate viruses.
      Manual counting plaques are time-consuming and subjective. There is a need to
      reduce the workload in plaque counting and for a machine to read virus plaque
      assay; thus, herein, we developed a machine-learning (ML)-based automated
      quantification machine for viral plaque counting. The machine consists of two
      major systems: hardware for image acquisition and ML-based software for image
      viral plaque counting. The hardware is relatively simple to set up, affordable,
      portable, and automatically acquires a single image or multiple images from a
      multiwell plate for users. For a 96-well plate, the machine could capture and
      display all images in less than 1 min. The software is implemented by K-mean
      clustering using ML and unsupervised learning algorithms to help users and reduce
      the number of setup parameters for counting and is evaluated using 96-well plates
      of dengue virus. Bland-Altman analysis indicates that more than 95% of the
      measurement error is in the upper and lower boundaries [+/-2 standard deviation].
      Also, gage repeatability and reproducibility analysis showed that the machine is 
      capable of applications. Moreover, the average correct measurements by the
      machine are 85.8%. The ML-based automated quantification machine effectively
      quantifies the number of viral plaques.

TI  - Epidemiology of Indigenous Dengue Cases in Zhejiang Province, Southeast China.
PG  - 857911
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.857911 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Autochthonous transmission of the dengue virus (DENV) occurred each
      year from 2014 to 2018 in Zhejiang province, and became an emerging public health
      problem. We characterized the autochthonous transmission of the DENV and traced
      the source of infection for further control and prevention of dengue. Methods:
      Descriptive and spatiotemporal cluster analyses were conducted to characterize
      the epidemiology of autochthonous transmission of the DENV. Molecular
      epidemiology was used to identify the infection source. Results: In total, 1,654 
      indigenous cases and 12 outbreaks, with no deaths, were reported during
      2004-2018. Before 2017, all outbreaks occurred in suburban areas. During
      2017-2018, five out of eight outbreaks occurred in urban areas. The median
      duration of outbreaks (28 days) in 2017-2018 was shortened significantly (P =
      0.028) in comparison with that in 2004-2016 (71 days). The median onset-visiting 
      time, visiting-confirmation time, and onset-confirmation time was 1, 3, and 4
      days, respectively. The DENV serotypes responsible for autochthonous transmission
      in Zhejiang Province were DENV 1, DENV 2, and DENV 3, with DENV 1 being the most 
      frequently reported. Southeast Asia was the predominant source of indigenous
      infection. Conclusions: Zhejiang Province witnessed an increase in the frequency,
      incidence, and geographic expansion of indigenous Dengue cases in recent years.
      The more developed coastal and central region of Zhejiang Province was impacted
      the most.

AB  - Dengue virus is part of the flaviviruses that spread through the Aedes mosquito
      species and causes vascular leakage and multiple organ failure. The
      non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is involved in the replication of Dengue virus.
      The glycosylated dimeric and hexameric form of NS1 is the biologically active
      form. Therefore, in this study, the NS1 protein was modeled in dimeric form which
      is predominantly present inside the host cell. The dimeric model was validated
      and it was glycosylated at ASN130 and ASN207 with oligomannose. This model was
      simulated for 100 ns to retrieve the global minima structure. The andrographolide
      and its four derivatives were docked non-specifically against the dimeric
      glycosylated NS1 protein. The neo-andrographolide compound showed strong
      interactions with favorable binding energy of -8.2 kcal/mol and electrostatic
      binding affinity of -8.9 kcal/mol. All docked ligand-protein complexes were
      simulated for 100 ns. The molecular dynamics simulation analysis comprising of
      root mean square deviation and fluctuation, the radius of gyration, hydrogen
      bonding, potential energy, principal component analysis, SASA, DSSP, Free energy 
      Landscape, MM-PBSA and Electrostatic binding affinity revealed about the
      stability of complex systems. These andrographolide and its derivatives was found
      to be interacting with Lys14 and this residue was reported as one of the
      important residues in NS1 activity. Among all compounds, the neo-andrographolide 
      compound has the promising potential to inhibit the activity of the NS1 which is 
      necessary for the Dengue virus replication. HighlightsThe dimeric NS1 protein
      structure was modeled and glycosylated at ASN130 and ASN 207 with
      Oligo-mannose.The minimized structure was used for molecular docking studies with
      andrographolide and its derivatives.The Lys14 residue is well interfered by all
      compounds but based on molecular dynamics and binding affinity studies,
      neo-andrographolide compound has the promising potential to inhibit the activity 
      of the NS1.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

LID - 10.7883/yoken.JJID.2021.837 [doi]
AB  - Hantavirus; Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an emerging zoonotic 
      disease in Euro-Asia which is clinically indistinguishable from leptospirosis. A 
      total number of 1032 patients were included in the analysis from March 2013 to
      March 2021 with the clinical suspicion of HFRS-like illness. Of them, 168
      patients were positive for hantavirus IgM antibodies. Thirty-one patients out of 
      35 patients had given a four-fold rise IgG antibody titre with paired serum
      confirming the acute hantavirus infections. Detected antibodies showed a diverse 
      pattern, strongly cross-reacting with Seoul, Hantaan and Puumala virus antigens. 
      All the IgM positive patients had no serological evidence of acute dengue or
      leptospirosis and had classical features of HFRS; fever, thrombocytopenia and
      renal involvement. More than 90% of patients had a history of rodent exposure 2-3
      weeks prior to the onset of the fever. The highest number of positive cases were 
      diagnosed from the Western and North-Central Provinces of Sri Lanka during the
      paddy harvesting seasons. A significant number of patients had developed severe
      complications with a high mortality rate. Therefore, hantavirus infection should 
      be considered as a differential diagnosis for leptospirosis-like illness in Sri
      Lanka.

AB  - Signal amplification have been centralized in developing the highly reliable
      biosensor for analyte detection with a narrow detection window. We proposed an
      aptasensor to provide a highly sensitive early-stage diagnostic platform of
      dengue virus NS1 protein (DENV-NS1) by dual-approach - colorimetric and
      electrochemical detection. This work utilized two different aptamers specific to 
      DENV-NS1: One conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), forming AuNPs-Apt1 and
      its complementary sequence aptamer, forming AuNPs-Apt2. The unbound Apt1 of
      AuNPs-Apt1 by DENV-NS1 were to hybridize to AuNPs-Apt2 and induced a
      3D-nanoassembled formation, resulting in DENV-NS1 concentration-dependent
      plasmonic color change. Occurrence of the hybridization of Apt1 and Apt2, the
      3D-assembled hybridized aptamers of AuNPs was incubated with methylene blue (MB) 
      solution, which intercalated a high number of MB molecules within the duplex
      structure of aptamers, and the complex was captured on the Apt2-conjugated
      disposable gold electrode (DGE). The developed aptamer-based biosensor showed
      high sensitivity with colorimetric response down to 1.28 pg/mL and
      electrochemical approach down to 30 fg/mL of DENV-NS1 with good selectivity. This
      work showcases an advanced utilization of aptamer and its complementary
      anti-sense aptamer in signal amplification and nanocarrier for biosensing.

TI  - Infectious diseases and predominant travel-related syndromes among long-term
      expatriates living in low-and middle- income countries: a scoping review.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1186/s40794-022-00168-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Expatriates working in low-and middle-income countries have unique 
      health problems. Migration leads not only to an increase in individual health
      risk but also a risk of global impact, such as pandemics. Expatriates with no
      prior experience living in tropical settings have expressed greatest concern
      about infectious diseases and appropriate peri-travel consultation is essential
      to expatriates. The objective of this review is to describe infections and
      travel-related syndromes among expatriates living in low-and middle-income
      countries. METHODS: MEDLINE database since the year 2000 was searched for
      relevant literature. Search terms were "long-term travel", "expatriate", and
      "health problems". The additional references were obtained from hand-searching of
      selected articles. RESULTS: Up to 80% of expatriates suffered from
      gastrointestinal problems followed by dermatologic problems (up to 40%), and
      febrile systemic infection/vector-borne/parasitic infection (up to 34%)
      Expatriates living in Southeast Asia were at risk of vector-borne diseases
      including dengue and non-Plasmodium falciparum (pf) malaria while expatriates
      living in South Asia had a high prevalence of acute and chronic diarrhea. Staying
      long-term in Africa was related to an elevated risk for pf malaria and
      gastrointestinal infection. In Latin America, dermatologic problems were commonly
      reported illnesses among expatriates. CONCLUSION: Certain health risks for
      expatriates who are going to depart to specific regions should be the focus of
      pre-travel consultation. Specific health preparations may reduce the risk of
      disease throughout their time abroad. Disease and symptom awareness is essential 
      for screening, early diagnosis, and better health outcomes for ill-expatriates.

TI  - A metapopulation approach to identify targets for Wolbachia-based dengue control.
PG  - 041105
LID - 10.1063/5.0087435 [doi]
AB  - Over the last decade, the release of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti into the
      natural habitat of this mosquito species has become the most sustainable and
      long-lasting technique to prevent and control vector-borne diseases, such as
      dengue, zika, or chikungunya. However, the limited resources to generate such
      mosquitoes and their effective distribution in large areas dominated by the Aedes
      aegypti vector represent a challenge for policymakers. Here, we introduce a
      mathematical framework for the spread of dengue in which competition between wild
      and Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, the cross-contagion patterns between humans
      and vectors, the heterogeneous distribution of the human population in different 
      areas, and the mobility flows between them are combined. Our framework allows us 
      to identify the most effective areas for the release of Wolbachia-infected
      mosquitoes to achieve a large decrease in the global dengue prevalence.

AB  - The present study is focused on synthesis of silver nanoparticles from weeds and 
      an assessment of their mosquito larvicidal efficacy. This study also presented
      the toxicological effects as well as the stability of these nanoparticles in
      aquatic mesocosms. The weed Digiteria sanguinallis was first time used for the
      synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles were
      characterized by various analytical techniques, such as UV-VIS, TEM, FESEM, EDX, 
      XRD, FTIR, and zeta potential study. The result revealed that the nanoparticles
      are crystalline, spherical shape with band gap 2.44 eV, and average size 18 nm.
      The LC50 value of synthesized AgNPs were recorded as 7.47 and 6.31 mg/L at 24 h
      against Cx. quinquefasciatus and A. albopictus respectively. In contrast,
      larvicidal activity of weed extract was insignificant against two target species.
      In aquatic mesocosm study, AgNPs (LC50 dose) does not alter the nature of water
      parameters within experimental period. However only EC % and ORP were changes
      because of silver ion oxidation. In biochemical parameters, only stress enzymes
      for animal and plant species were moderately altered under long term exposure.
      But glycogen, protein, and AchE of two mosquito species were significantly
      changed under same mesocosm setup within short exposure. Comparatively, in
      control mesocosm, synthesized AgNPs are naturally change their nano form within
      20 days with the presence of all non-target species and pond sediment. Therefore,
      it can be concluded that biosynthesized AgNPs could be used as a larvicidal agent
      in near future with negligible effects on aquatic organisms.

AB  - The recent worldwide spread of viral infections has highlighted the need for
      accurate, fast, and inexpensive disease diagnosis and monitorization methods.
      Current diagnostics tend to focus either on molecular or serological testing. In 
      this work we propose a dual detection assay approach for viral diseases, where
      both serological and molecular assays are combined in a single analysis performed
      on a magnetoresistive system. This type of assay guarantees an accurate
      assessment of the infection phase, saving time and costs associated with multiple
      independent tests. Zika and dengue viruses were used as model diseases for the
      validation of the system. Human IgG anti-zika and anti-dengue antibodies were
      successfully detected in infected patients' serum, using a novel approach
      combining competitive and sandwich strategies in a magnetoresistive portable
      platform. Specificity and sensitivity values of 100% were obtained. Calibration
      curves with dynamic ranges between 10 ng/mL and 1 mug/mL were established
      achieving LODs of 1.26 and 1.38 nM for IgG anti-ZIKV and anti-DENV antibodies,
      respectively. Viral RNA detection down to a few hundreds of pM was also
      successfully carried out after the design of specific oligo probes and primers
      for RT-PCR amplification. Dual assays were performed for both viruses, where
      viral RNA and anti-virus antibodies in serum samples were simultaneously
      detected. The results obtained for the detection of the molecular and serological
      targets in the dual assay format show no significant difference between the ones 
      obtained individually, proving the feasibility and accuracy of the dual detection
      assay. This assay format represents a new paradigm in viral infections
      diagnostics.

TI  - Level of dengue preventive practices and associated factors in a Malaysian
      residential area during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study.
PG  - e0267899
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0267899 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is endemic in
      more than 100 countries and has the highest incidence among infectious diseases
      in Malaysia. The increase of dengue fever cases during the COVID-19 pandemic and 
      the movement control order (MCO) highlighted the necessity to assess the dengue
      preventive practices among the population. Thus, this study aimed to determine
      the level of dengue preventive practices and its associated factors among
      residents in a residential area in Johor, Malaysia during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      METHOD: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 303 respondents 
      from a Johor residential area between May and June 2021. A validated
      self-administered questionnaire was created using google forms and distributed to
      the respondents via WhatsApp. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: (i) 
      Sociodemographic characteristics and history of dengue fever, (ii) dengue
      preventive practices, and (iii) six constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM). 
      The association between the dependent and independent variables were examined
      using multiple logistic regression with a significant level set at less than
      0.05. RESULT: About half of the respondents have a good level of dengue
      preventive practices. Respondents with a history of dengue fever (aOR = 2.1, 95% 
      CI: 1.1-4.2, p = 0.033), low perceived susceptibility (aOR = 1.8, 95% CI:
      1.1-3.0, p = 0.018), high self-efficacy (aOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-2.8, p = 0.045), 
      and high cues to take action (aOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.5-4.2, p < 0.001) had higher
      odds of practicing good dengue preventive measures. CONCLUSION: This study
      demonstrated a moderate level of dengue preventive practices during the COVID-19 
      pandemic. Therefore, a stronger dengue control programme is recommended by
      focusing on cues to take action, self-efficacy, and recruiting those with a
      history of dengue fever to assist health authorities in promoting good dengue
      preventive practices in the community.

TI  - Human Seroprevalence for Dengue, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses in
      Australia and the Pacific: A systematic review spanning seven decades.
PG  - e0010314
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010314 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue (DENV), Ross River (RRV) and Barmah Forest viruses (BFV) are
      the most common human arboviral infections in Australia and the Pacific Island
      Countries and Territories (PICTs) and are associated with debilitating symptoms. 
      All are nationally notifiable in Australia, but routine surveillance is limited
      to a few locations in the PICTs. Understanding the level of human exposure to
      these viruses can inform disease management and mitigation strategies. To assess 
      the historic and current seroprevalence of DENV, RRV and BFV in Australia and the
      PICTs we conducted a systematic literature review of all published quantitative
      serosurveys. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Preferred Reporting of Items
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures were adopted to produce a
      protocol to systematically search for published studies reporting the
      seroprevalence of DENV, RRV and BFV in Australia and the PICTs. Data for author, 
      research year, location, study population, serosurvey methods and positive tests 
      were extracted. A total of 41 papers, reporting 78 serosurveys of DENV, RRV and
      BFV including 62,327 samples met the inclusion criteria for this review.
      Seroprevalence varied depending on the assay used, strategy of sample collection 
      and location of the study population. Significant differences were observed in
      reported seropositivity depending on the sample collection strategy with
      clinically targeted sampling reporting the highest seroprevalence across all
      three viruses. Non-stratified seroprevalence showed wide ranges in reported
      positivity with DENV 0.0% - 95.6%, RRV 0.0% - 100.0%, and BFV 0.3% - 12.5%. We
      discuss some of the causes of variation including serological methods used,
      selection bias in sample collection including clinical or environmental
      associations, and location of study site. We consider the extent to which
      serosurveys reflect the epidemiology of the viruses and provide broad
      recommendations regarding the conduct and reporting of arbovirus serosurveys.
      CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Human serosurveys provide important information on 
      the extent of human exposure to arboviruses across: (1) time, (2) place, and (3) 
      person (e.g., age, gender, clinical presentation etc). Interpreting results
      obtained at these scales has the potential to inform us about transmission
      cycles, improve diagnostic surveillance, and mitigate future outbreaks. Future
      research should streamline methods and reduce bias to allow a better
      understanding of the burden of these diseases and the factors associated with
      seroprevalence. Greater consideration should be given to the interpretation of
      seroprevalence in studies, and increased rigour applied in linking seroprevalence
      to transmission dynamics.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) which infects about 390 million people per year in tropical
      and subtropical areas manifests various disease symptoms, ranging from fever to
      life-threatening hemorrhage and even shock. To date, there is still no effective 
      treatment for DENV disease, but only supportive care. DENV nonstructural protein 
      1 (NS1) has been shown to play a key role in disease pathogenesis. Recent studies
      have shown that anti-DENV NS1 antibody can provide disease protection by blocking
      the DENV-induced disruption of endothelial integrity. We previously demonstrated 
      that anti-NS1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) protected mice from all four serotypes of
      DENV challenge. Here, we generated humanized anti-NS1 mAbs and transferred them
      to mice after DENV infection. The results showed that DENV-induced prolonged
      bleeding time and skin hemorrhage were reduced, even several days after DENV
      challenge. Mechanistic studies showed the ability of humanized anti-NS1 mAbs to
      inhibit NS1-induced vascular hyperpermeability and to elicit Fcgamma-dependent
      complement-mediated cytolysis as well as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
      of cells infected with four serotypes of DENV. These results highlight humanized 
      anti-NS1 mAb as a potential therapeutic agent in DENV infection.

TI  - Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability among health professions students in
      Vietnam.
PG  - 854

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy or refusal has actually been a threat 
      to global health. In the current situation, health professions students are at
      risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection during their internship at healthcare facilities.
      Furthermore, those future healthcare workers will advise people to accept the
      COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, the attitude of students towards vaccine
      acceptance and the predicting factors needs to be elucidated. This study applied 
      the Health Belief Model to determine predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability
      among health professions students. METHODS: Nine hundred eleven students
      participated in a cross-sectional online survey in Vietnam. Data were collected
      from 1st April to 30th June 2021. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software
      version 20.0 with Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests before executing
      multinomial logistic regression to identify predictors of the COVID-19 vaccine
      acceptability RESULTS: The overall vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal
      rates were 58% (95% CI: 54.7% - 61.3%), 40.4% (95% CI: 37.2% - 43.7%) and 1.5%
      (95% CI: 0.8% - 2.6%), respectively. Regarding vaccination hesitancy, a predictor
      such as "Receiving recent flu shots" had a negative correlation, whereas
      "Vaccines have little efficacy & serious adverse effects" (Perceived barriers),
      nationality, and majors were positive correlates. For refusal, "Unvaccinated
      students feasibly infected COVID-19 during hospital internship" (Perceived
      susceptibility) was a negative correlate. For predicting both hesitancy and
      refusal, "Mass media appreciating effectiveness and safety of vaccines" (Cues to 
      action), and " Health professions students get serious complications of COVID-19 
      if not vaccinated" (Perceived severity) were negative predictors. In contrast,
      "Manufacturers do not disclose adverse effects of vaccines" (Cues to action), and
      "Adverse effect causes death" (Perceived barrier) were recognized as positive
      predictors. Strong Health Belief Model predictors of vaccine refusal were
      "Manufacturers do not disclose adverse effects of vaccines" (Cues to action) with
      OR= 5.299(95% CI: 1.687-16.641, p= 0.004), and "Adverse effect causes death"
      (Perceived barrier) with OR= 10.255 (95% CI = 3.528-29.814, p= 0.0005).
      CONCLUSION: Health professions students' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination
      might be based on the perceived susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19,
      concerns about vaccine efficacy and safety, and the influence levels of
      information from various sources. Health education and measures to prevent the
      harmful effects of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation could potentially improve the 
      acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine.

      Aedes albopictus.
PG  - 6973
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-10977-4 [doi]
AB  - The mosquito Aedes albopictus is an invasive species first detected in Europe in 
      Albania in 1979, and now established in 28 European countries. Temperature is a
      limiting factor in mosquito activities and in the transmission of associated
      arboviruses namely chikungunya (CHIKV) and dengue (DENV). Since 2007, local
      transmissions of CHIKV and DENV have been reported in mainland Europe, mainly in 
      South Europe. Thus, the critical question is how far north transmission could
      occur. In this context, the Albanian infestation by Ae. albopictus is of interest
      because the species is present up to 1200 m of altitude; this allows using
      altitude as a proxy for latitude. Here we show that Ae. albopictus can transmit
      CHIKV at 28 degrees C as well as 20 degrees C, however, the transmission of DENV 
      is only observed at 28 degrees C. We conclude that if temperature is the key
      environmental factor limiting transmission, then transmission of CHIKV, but not
      DENV is feasible in much of Europe.

TI  - Dengue Virus and Platelets: From the Biology to the Clinic.
PG  - 349-358
LID - 10.1089/vim.2021.0135 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is one of the most important vector-borne viral illnesses found in
      tropical and subtropical regions. Colombia has one of the highest rates of dengue
      cases in the Americas. Severe dengue virus (DENV) infection presents with
      capillary leakage, hemorrhage, and organ compromise, eventually leading to death.
      Over the years, there have been many efforts to develop a vaccine that guarantees
      protective immunity, but they have been partially successful, as such immunity
      would need to guarantee protection against four distinct viral serotypes.
      Absolute platelet count is a laboratory parameter used to monitor the clinical
      progression of DENV, as infection is often accompanied by thrombocytopenia.
      Although this finding is well described with respect to the natural history of
      the disease, there are various hypotheses as to the cause of this rapid decrease,
      and several in vivo and ex vivo models have been used to explain the effect of
      DENV infection on platelets and their precursors. DENV infects and activates
      platelets, facilitating their elimination through recognition by phagocytic cells
      and peripheral margination. However, infection also affects the precursors in the
      bone marrow by modulating megakaryopoiesis. The objective of this article is to
      explore various proposed mechanisms of DENV-induced thrombocytopenia to better
      understand the pathophysiology and clinical presentations of this highly relevant
      viral infection.

AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses infect both mosquito and mammalian hosts. While much is
      known about virus-host interactions that modulate viral gene expression in their 
      mammalian host, much less is known about the interactions that involve
      inhibition, subversion or avoidance strategies in the mosquito host. A novel
      RNA-Protein interaction detection assay was used to detect proteins that directly
      or indirectly bind to dengue viral genomes in infected mosquito cells.
      Membrane-associated mosquito proteins Sec61A1 and Loquacious (Loqs) were found to
      be in complex with the viral RNA. Depletion analysis demonstrated that both
      Sec61A1 and Loqs have pro-viral functions in the dengue viral infectious cycle.
      Co-localization and pull-down assays showed that Loqs interacts with viral
      protein NS3 and both full-length and subgenomic viral RNAs. While Loqs coats the 
      entire positive-stranded viral RNA, it binds selectively to the 3' end of the
      negative-strand of the viral genome. In-depth analyses showed that the absence of
      Loqs did not affect translation or turnover of the viral RNA but modulated viral 
      replication. Loqs also displayed pro-viral functions for several flaviviruses in 
      infected mosquito cells, suggesting a conserved role for Loqs in
      flavivirus-infected mosquito cells.

TI  - Generation of Mature DENVs via Genetic Modification and Directed Evolution.
PG  - e0038622
LID - 10.1128/mbio.00386-22 [doi]
AB  - Maturation of dengue viruses (DENVs) alters the structure, immunity, and
      infectivity of the virion and highly mature particles represent the dominant form
      in vivo. The production of highly mature virions principally relies on the
      structure and function of the viral premature membrane protein (prM) and its
      cleavage by the host protease furin. We redeveloped a reliable clonal cell line
      (VF1) which produces single-round mature DENVs without the need for DENV reverse 
      genetics. More importantly, using protein engineering and directed evolution of
      the prM cleavage site, we engineered genetically stable mature DENVs in all
      serotypes independent of cell or host, usually with minimal impact on viral
      yield. Using these complementary strategies to regulate maturation, we
      demonstrate that the resulting mature DENVs are antigenically distinct from their
      isogenic partially mature forms. Given the clinical importance of mature DENVs in
      immunity, our study provides reliable strategies and reagents for the production 
      of stable, high-titer mature DENVs for DENV antibody neutralization and
      vaccination immunity studies. Biologically, our data from directed evolution
      across host species reveals distinct maturation-dependent selective pressures
      between mammalian and insect cells, verifying the substrate preference between
      mammalian and insect furin, while hinting at an evolutionary equilibrium of DENV 
      prM cleavage site between its host and vector in nature. IMPORTANCE Mature DENVs 
      represent the dominant form in vivo and are the target for vaccine development.
      Here, we used multiple strategies, including protein engineering and natural and 
      directed evolution to generate DENV1, -2, -3, and -4 variants that are highly
      mature without compromising replication efficiency compared to the parental
      strains. Given the clinical importance of mature DENVs in immunity, this work
      provides a roadmap for engineering highly mature DENV that could apply to future 
      vaccine development. Our directed-evolution data also shed light on the divergent
      evolutionary relationship of DENVs between its host and vector.

TI  - Regulatory Role of Host MicroRNAs in Flaviviruses Infection.
PG  - 869441
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.869441 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA that affect mRNA abundance or
      translation efficiency by binding to the 3'UTR of the mRNA of the target gene,
      thereby participating in multiple biological processes, including viral
      infection. Flavivirus genus consists of small, positive-stranded, single-stranded
      RNA viruses transmitted by arthropods, especially mosquitoes and ticks. The genus
      contains several globally significant human/animal pathogens, such as Dengue
      virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Yellow fever
      virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Tembusu virus. After flavivirus
      invades, the expression of host miRNA changes, exerting the immune escape
      mechanism to create an environment conducive to its survival, and the altered
      miRNA in turn affects the life cycle of the virus. Accumulated evidence suggests 
      that host miRNAs influence flavivirus replication and host-virus interactions
      through direct binding of viral genomes or through virus-mediated host
      transcriptome changes. Furthermore, miRNA can also interweave with other
      non-coding RNAs, such as long non-coding RNA and circular RNA, to form an
      interaction network to regulate viral replication. A variety of non-coding RNAs
      produced by the virus itself exert similar function by interacting with cellular 
      RNA and viral RNA. Understanding the interaction sites between non-coding RNA,
      especially miRNA, and virus/host genes will help us to find targets for antiviral
      drugs and viral therapy.

TI  - Bionomic aspects of dengue vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus at domestic
      settings in urban, suburban and rural areas in Gampaha District, Western Province
      of Sri Lanka.
PG  - 148
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05261-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The lack of information on behavioural patterns of Aedes aegypti and 
      Aedes albopictus has become a significant limitation in vector control and
      disease management programmes. Therefore, the current study was focused on
      determining some bionomics aspects: breeding, resting, host-seeking and feeding
      preferences of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in Sri Lanka. METHODS: Larval and
      adult surveys were conducted from April 2017 to April 2019 monthly in six
      selected Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas in Gampaha Distinct, Western
      province, Sri Lanka, representing urban, suburban and rural settings. Resting
      preferences of adult mosquitoes were observed from indoor and outdoor places
      using a Prockopack aspirator. The information on resting height, surface,
      material and locality was recorded. Human-baited double-net traps were used to
      determine the host-seeking time of Aedes mosquitoes. Statistical differences in
      the spatial distribution of mosquitoes in selected MOH areas and prevalence of
      vectors were analysed using general linear model (GLM). A chi-square test was
      used to analyse the resting behaviour. RESULTS: Total of 19,835 potential
      breeding sites were examined at 13,563 premises, and 18.5% (n = 1856) were
      positive for Aedes larvae. Distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus was
      statistically significant at species level (df = 1; F = 137.134; P < 0.05 GLM)
      and study setting (df = 2; F = 8.125; P < 0.05). Aedes aegypti breeding was found
      mainly in temporary removals (18.8%; n = 34), discarded non-degradables (12.15%; 
      n = 22) and tyres (9.95%; n = 18). Natural (14.7%; n = 246) and temporary
      removals (13.6%; n = 227) and discarded non-reusable items were the key
      ovipositing sites for Ae. albopictus. In the adult mosquito survey, the majority 
      was comprised of Ae. albopictus (54.5%; n = 999), which denoted exophilic nature 
      (90.8%; n = 758), and 45.5% (n = 835) represented by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes who
      were mainly endophilic (84.3%; n = 842). Aedes aegypti rested on cloth hangings
      and curtains, followed by the furniture, while Aedes albopictus was predominant
      in outdoor vegetation. In both vectors, biting patterns denoted a typical diurnal
      pattern with two peaks of host-seeking and biting activity in the morning and
      afternoon. CONCLUSIONS: The majority (80%) of the larval habitats were artificial
      containers. The use of larvicides for vector control as the prominent measure is 
      questionable since applying these chemicals may target only 20% of the total
      breeding grounds, which are permanent. The resting places of adult mosquitoes are
      mainly indoors. Therefore, using thermal space spraying of insecticide may not be
      appropriate, and indoor residual spraying is recommended as a suitable
      intervention to target adult mosquitoes. This study warrants a holistic vector
      control approach for all medically important mosquitoes and insects, ensuring the
      rational use of finance and resources.

TI  - Generation and Characterization of Human-Mouse STING Chimeras That Allow DENV
      Replication in Mouse Cells.
PG  - e0091421
LID - 10.1128/msphere.00914-21 [doi]
AB  - Our group was the first to describe direct antagonism of the cyclic GMP-AMP
      synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway by dengue virus
      (DENV) in human cells, and here, we report new findings on the characterization
      of the interaction between the DENV nonstructural protein 2B (NS2B)-NS3 (NS2B3)
      protease complex and STING. We demonstrate interactions between NS2B and the
      transmembrane domains of human STING and between NS3 and a portion of the
      cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of human STING. One significant obstacle we face
      today in the DENV field is the lack of small animal models available that can
      effectively recapitulate DENV pathogenesis in the early events of infection. The 
      existing mouse models are either immunocompromised mice lacking interferon (IFN) 
      receptors or "humanized" mice reconstituted with human stem cells. However, both 
      approaches fail to capture important aspects of human pathogenesis because they
      lack critical innate immunity components or have deficiencies in immune cell
      development or maintenance. As an important step toward developing an
      immunocompetent mouse model for DENV, we have generated two chimeric human-mouse 
      STING constructs that have promise in retaining both cleavability by NS2B3 and
      signaling capacity in the mouse. IMPORTANCE This article characterizes the
      interaction between human STING and DENV viral protease complex NS2B3 by
      constructing serial deletion mutants of STING. Our findings suggest that DENV
      nonstructural protein NS2B interacts with the transmembrane domains and NS3 with 
      the C-terminal cyclic dinucleotide binding domain of human STING. Furthermore, as
      there exists no ideal immunocompetent murine model that can simultaneously
      support robust DENV replication and recapitulate the clinical manifestation of
      dengue disease observed in humans, we expressed and characterized two promising
      human-mouse chimeric STING constructs that can be used for developing a relevant 
      transgenic mouse model to study dengue in the future. Both constructs can
      activate normal IFN responses in the overexpression system and be cleaved under
      infection conditions. We believe our findings offer a roadmap to the further
      development of a murine model that can greatly facilitate antiviral discoveries
      and vaccine research for DENV.

AB  - The azaindole (AI) framework continues to play a significant role in the design
      of new antiviral agents. Modulating the position and isosteric replacement of the
      nitrogen atom of AI analogs notably influences the intrinsic physicochemical
      properties of lead compounds. The intra- and intermolecular interactions of AI
      derivatives with host receptors or viral proteins can also be fine tuned by
      carefully placing the nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic core. This wide-ranging
      perspective article focuses on AIs that have considerable utility in drug
      discovery programs against RNA viruses. The inhibition of influenza A, human
      immunodeficiency, respiratory syncytial, neurotropic alpha, dengue, ebola, and
      hepatitis C viruses by AI analogs is extensively reviewed to assess their
      plausible future potential in antiviral drug discovery. The binding interaction
      of AIs with the target protein is examined to derive a structural basis for
      designing new antiviral agents.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on seasonal respiratory
      viruses is unknown in sub-tropical climates. METHODS: We compared weekly testing 
      and test-positivity of respiratory infections in the 2019-2020 respiratory season
      to the 2012-2018 seasons in southern Puerto Rico using Wilcoxon signed rank
      tests. RESULTS: Compared to the average for the 2012-2018 seasons,
      test-positivity was significantly lower for Influenza A (p<0.001) & B (p<0.001), 
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (p<0.01), respiratory adenovirus (AdV)
      (p<0.05), and other respiratory viruses (p<0.001) following March 2020 COVID-19
      stay at home orders. CONCLUSIONS: Mitigation measures and behavioral social
      distancing choices may have reduced respiratory viral spread in southern Puerto
      Rico.

TI  - Rotational thromboelastometry in critical phase of dengue infection: Association 
      with bleeding.
PG  - e12704
LID - 10.1002/rth2.12704 [doi]
AB  - Background: The critical phase of dengue carries a high risk of bleeding.
      Associations of coagulation test parameters and the risk of bleeding in the
      critical phase is unclear. This study examines the association of rotational
      thromboelastometry (ROTEM delta and ROTEM platelet) with bleeding risk of
      patients with dengue in the critical phase. Methods: A total of 105 patients with
      confirmed dengue in the critical phase were recruited, with two subsequent
      prospective time point analyses of ROTEM parameters and platelet count within 24 
      and 48 hours from the onset of the critical phase. Conventional coagulation tests
      were performed only at the initial time point. Results: Twenty of 105 patients
      developed bleeding after onset of the critical phase. Within the first 24 hours
      of critical-phase onset, platelet count, coagulation tests, and ROTEM delta were 
      unable to differentiate patients with bleeding manifestations from those without 
      (P < .05). Area under the curve of thrombin receptor activating peptide-6 assay
      of ROTEM platelet (TRAPTEM) discriminated patients with bleeding manifestations
      from those without, at a cutoff value of <12.5 Omega*min at a sensitivity and
      specificity of 73.7%, and 60.2%. In patients who developed bleeding, the maximum 
      lysis of extrinsic pathway of ROTEM was significantly lower in patients with
      severe bleeding compared to those with mild to moderate bleeding. (4.3 +/- 3.4%
      vs 9.4 +/- 7.5%; P = .01). Conclusion: An association with bleeding
      manifestations and TRAPTEM suggest a potential role for defective platelet
      aggregation in the pathogenesis of bleeding in the critical phase of dengue.

TI  - Tetravalent formulation of polymeric nanoparticle-based vaccine induces a potent 
      immune response against dengue virus.
PG  - 2917-2928
LID - 10.1039/d2bm00167e [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the four serotypes of the dengue
      virus (DENV 1-4). It is growing at an alarming rate globally, which could be
      partly attributed to the lack of an effective therapeutic regimen. Therefore,
      strategies for developing an effective vaccine have gained more significance in
      the given scenario. Failure of the existing live attenuated vaccine candidates to
      mount effective and broader protection against all the four serotypes of DENV has
      generated a new interest in exploring novel strategies for augmenting the
      efficacy of non-infectious, non-replicating subunit vaccines. In the current
      study, we employed a new strategy of encapsulating the immunodominant EDIII
      domain of Envelop protein of all the serotypes of DENV (1-4) into PLGA
      nanoparticles separately. All four nano formulations were physically mixed to
      develop a tetravalent nano formulation in combination with TLR agonists. Further,
      we examined its immunological efficacy using a mouse and in vitro infection model
      system. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that majority of EDIII protein
      loaded PLGA nanoparticles were polydispersed and less than 1 mum in size with
      optimal encapsulation efficacy. Tetravalent nanoformulation along with TLR
      agonists (MPLA + R837) enhanced the magnitude of antigen-specific polyfunctional 
      T cell response. It triggered robust antibody responses in mice concurrent with
      the increased level of genes involved in the programming of memory B-cell
      formation and the maintenance and maturation of GCs, leading to the formation of 
      long-lived plasma cells secreting antigen-specific antibodies. Further assessment
      revealed that tetravalent nanoformulation in combination with TLR ligands upon
      immunization in mice aids in the enhanced production of serotype-specific
      neutralizing antibodies, which can effectively neutralize all the four serotypes 
      of DENV (DENV 1-4). The findings of this study reveal a new strategy for
      enhancing the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates and might pave the way for the
      development of a tetravalent vaccine against all the serotypes of Dengue Virus.

TI  - Fever in the Returning Traveler.
LID - 10.3238/arztebl.m2022.0182 [doi]
LID - arztebl.m2022.0182 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is predicted that approximately two billion tourist trips to
      foreign countries will be taken worldwide each year by 2030. Germany has long
      been among the most active countries in tourism. The frequency of illness among
      persons returning from developing and newly industrialized countries is 43-79%.
      The appropriate diagnosis of fever in returning travelers is a clinically
      important matter, as it can be a sign of a life-threatening illness. METHODS:
      This review is based on publications (2001-2022) retrieved by a selective search 
      in PubMed for studies on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of febrile
      illnesses in returning travelers, or on specific tropical diseases. RESULTS:
      Diarrhea, fever, and skin changes are the most common manifestations of disease
      after travel to tropical and subtropical areas. The diagnostic evaluation should 
      be performed in a series of steps, beginning with a precise travel history and
      the identification of specific risk factors. Among travelers returning from
      sub-Saharan Africa, Plasmodium falciparum malaria is the most common cause of
      fever on presentation to centers for infectious diseases and tropical medicine,
      affecting approximately 50 per 1000 travelers. Among persons returning from
      travel to Southeast Asia, dengue fever is the most common infectious disease,
      affecting 50-160 per 1000 travelers. Further potentially dangerous diseases
      include chikungunya and zika fever, typhoid and paratyphoid fever, amoebic liver 
      abscess, visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), leptospirosis, and, very rarely,
      imported cases of viral hemorrhagic fever. COVID-19 and influenza are important
      differential diagnoses. CONCLUSION: The differential diagnosis can be narrowed by
      thorough history-taking with particular attention to the patient's travel route, 
      combined with a good knowledge of the geographic spread and incubation times of
      the main tropical diseases. Algorithms help clinicians to focus the diagnostic
      work-up and select the appropriate further laboratory tests and diagnostic
      procedures.

      the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries like
      Pakistan. Although rare, it is possible to have coinfection with organisms that
      are endemic in a region, causing diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas.
      Leptospirosis is caused by Gram-negative spirochetes. Leptospira are widely
      distributed and are transmitted by contamination of water and food by the urine
      of infected animals like rodents. Leptospirosis is characterized by fever, body
      aches, abdominal pain, and hepatic and renal involvement. Laboratory
      abnormalities include cytopenia, elevated bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase,
      and abnormal renal function tests. Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi
      (S. typhi), which is transmitted by fecal contamination of drinking water and
      food items. The clinical manifestations of typhoid fever include fever, abdominal
      pain, and diarrhea. Laboratory abnormalities include cytopenia and mildly
      deranged liver function tests. A strain of S. typhi resistant to all antibiotics 
      except azithromycin and carbapenems was isolated in 2016 in Pakistan. Most of the
      clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities of leptospirosis and typhoid
      fever overlap. There have been case reports of coinfection of S. typhi and
      Leptospira, but there is no report of coinfection of extensively drug-resistant
      (XDR) S. typhi and Leptospira. We present a case of a 20-year-old man with fever,
      loose motions, and jaundice from Peshawar, Pakistan who had coinfection of
      Leptospira and XDR S. typhi. The attending physicians should adopt Hickam's
      dictum instead of Occam's razor approach.

AB  - We are able to collect vast quantities of spatiotemporal data due to recent
      technological advances. Exploratory space-time data analysis approaches can
      facilitate the detection of patterns and formation of hypotheses about their
      driving processes. However, geographic patterns of social phenomena like crime or
      disease are driven by the underlying population. This research aims for
      incorporating temporal population dynamics into spatial analysis, a key omission 
      of previous methods. As population data are becoming available at finer spatial
      and temporal granularity, we are increasingly able to capture the dynamic
      patterns of human activity. In this paper, we modify the space-time kernel
      density estimation method by accounting for spatially and temporally dynamic
      background populations (ST-DB), assess the benefits of considering the temporal
      dimension and finally, compare ST-DB to its purely spatial counterpart. We
      delineate clusters and compare them, as well as their significance, across
      multiple parameter configurations. We apply ST-DB to an outbreak of dengue fever 
      in Cali, Colombia during 2010-2011. Our results show that incorporating the
      temporal dimension improves our ability to delineate significant clusters. This
      study addresses an urgent need in the spatiotemporal analysis literature by using
      population data at high spatial and temporal resolutions.

AB  - Dengue and chikungunya are two important mosquito-borne infections which are
      known to occur extensively in tropical and subtropical areas. Presently, there is
      no treatment for these viral diseases. In vitro antiviral screening of 25
      extracts prepared from the plants of Vitex negundo, Plumeria alba, Ancistrocladus
      heyneanus, Bacopa monnieri, Anacardium occidentale, Cucurbita maxima, Simarouba
      glauca, and Embelia ribes using different solvents and four purified compounds
      (anacardic acid, chloroquinone, glaucarubinone, and methyl gallate) were carried 
      out for their anti-dengue virus (DENV) and anti-chikungunya virus (CHIKV)
      activities. Maximum nontoxic concentrations of the chloroform, methanol, ethyl
      acetate, petroleum ether, dichloromethane, and hydroalcoholic extracts of eight
      plants were used. The antiviral activity was assessed by focus-forming unit
      assay, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence assays. Extracts
      from Plumeria alba, Ancistrocladus heyneanus, Bacopa monnieri, and Cucurbita
      maxima showed both anti-DENV and CHIKV activity while extract from Vitex negundo 
      showed only anti-DENV activity. Among the purified compounds, anacardic acid,
      chloroquinone and methyl gallate showed anti-dengue activity while only methyl
      gallate had anti-chikungunya activity. The present study had identified the plant
      extracts with anti-dengue and anti-chikungunya activities, and these extracts can
      be further characterized for finding effective phytopharmaceutical drugs against 
      dengue and chikungunya.

AB  - Background: Dengue is a common arthropod-borne viral disease with a variable
      clinical spectrum, course, and outcome. Method: We conducted a prospective
      observational study describing the clinical profile of patients hospitalized for 
      dengue with warning signs during the 2019 epidemic. Result: A total of 1349
      patients with dengue, including 459 with warning signs, were seen. It
      predominantly affects the younger subset of both sexes. A higher proportion of
      females presented with either a platelet count less than 20,000/mm(3) or a rapid 
      fall in platelets. Bleeding manifestations of varying severity were observed in
      one-fifth of them. Severe bleeding was universal at a platelet count less than
      10,000/mm(3). Platelet transfusion was indicated in 17 (7.3%) males and 25 (11%) 
      females, with females requiring it at a higher platelet count. While hepatic
      involvement was frequent, others such as myocarditis, encephalitis, and
      pancreatitis were infrequent. Coinfections observed included malaria, scrub
      typhus, and enteric fever. The case fatality rate for the patients with dengue
      and those with warning manifestations was 0.4% and 1.3%, respectively.
      Conclusions: Dengue epidemics often overwhelm health-care resources. Such
      epidemics can be successfully managed using a protocolized approach, modified as 
      per the available resources. Platelet transfusions are lifesaving at a count less
      than 10,000/mm(3). With meticulous supportive care, the case fatality rate can be
      reduced to less than 0.5%.

      pilot study.
PG  - 204-212
LID - 10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.12.036 [doi]
AB  - Background: Severe dengue causes more than 22,000 deaths annually worldwide.
      Complicated dengue has high mortality of 44-72%. Disordered immune system with
      capillary leak and thrombocytopenia are hallmark of complicated dengue.
      Intravenous immunoglobulin (IV Ig) therapy has shown to be effective in
      complicated dengue in pediatric age group with refractory shock, but studies in
      adults are lacking. Its immunoresuscitative role is not yet fully explored in
      critically ill patients with severe dengue. Methods: This is retrospective
      observational study of patients with complicated dengue fever who were
      administered IV Ig therapy in a tertiary care hospital of southern India from 01 
      Jan 2018 to 31 Dec 2019. Results: A total of 999 patients with dengue were
      admitted; 754 (75.47%) were males, and 245 (24.53%) were females. A total of 402 
      (40.24%) patients presented with warning signs. Bleeding was seen in 121 patients
      (12.11%); 102 (10.21%) had shock; 29 (2.90%) had acute kidney injury and 24
      (2.40%) had adult respiratory distress syndrome. Overall, four people died
      (mortality rate: 0.40%). IV Ig in the dose of 0.4 g/kg for 5 days was used in 13 
      critically ill patients where standard therapy failed, 9 patients with refractory
      shock (which included three with myocarditis with refractory shock), 2 with
      encephalitis, 2 in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Two patients died, one
      with myocarditis with refractory shock and another with refractory shock.
      Conclusion: IV Ig therapy in critically ill patients with complicated dengue can 
      be used as a rescue therapy.

AB  - Dengue outbreaks are a serious public health concern that occurs on a regular
      basis in various locations of India. According to the Government of India's
      National Center for Vector-Borne Disease Control, a total of 1,23,106 dengue
      cases were identified in India as of October 2021. The currently available dengue
      vaccine was found to be ineffective against all serotypes of the virus. Dengue
      virus serotype 2 was reported to be the sole predominant serotype in Eastern
      Uttar Pradesh, India. An epitope-based peptide vaccine is believed to be safe and
      effective against all serotypes of the dengue virus. In this work, an
      epitope-based peptide vaccine based on envelope protein against the dengue virus 
      was developed using the reverse vaccinology method. T-cell epitopes present in
      the envelope protein were screened using different immunoinformatic tools.
      Epitopes predicted by all servers were chosen and additionally picked out on the 
      grounds of their antigenic reactivity, immunogenicity, toxicity, and
      allergenicity assessment. Three potent T cell epitopes as IVQPENLEY, ILIGVVITW,
      and DTAWDFGSL were screened, which binds with HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*58:01,
      HLA-A*26:01 alleles, respectively. To build a 3D structure model of epitopes and 
      alleles, the PepstrMod and Swiss-Model servers were used. Predicted epitopes and 
      HLA alleles were docked using the HPEPDOCK server to confirm binding ability.
      These anticipated epitopes were found to cover the greatest number of populations
      in India and around the world. These identified epitopes have a high potential
      for eliciting an immune response in the development of a vaccine against the
      dengue virus, while further experimental validation is required for final
      confirmation. Supplementary Information: The online version contains

TI  - Myracrodruon urundeuva leaf lectin damages exochorionic cells and binds to the
      serosal cuticle of Aedes aegypti eggs.
PG  - 109

AB  - In recent years, lectins have been identified as alternative agents against Aedes
      aegypti during the aquatic phases of its life cycle. For example, chitin-binding 
      lectin from Myracrodruon urundeuva leaf (MuLL) can function as a larvicide. In
      this study, we investigated whether MuLL can also act as an ovicide against this 
      insect. Aedes aegypti eggs were incubated with MuLL for 72 h to determine the
      concentration at which the hatching rate reduces by 50% (EC50). The effects of
      MuLL on the egg surface structure were evaluated using scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM), and the possible interaction of MuLL with the internal
      structures of eggs and embryos was investigated using MuLL-fluorescein
      isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate. MuLL acted as an ovicidal agent with an EC50 of 
      0.88 mg/mL. The SEM analysis revealed that eggs treated with MuLL for 24 and 48 h
      no longer had tubercles and did not show a well-defined exochorionic network. In 
      addition, deformation and degeneration of the surface were observed after 72 h.
      Fluorescence microscopy showed that MuLL penetrated the eggs 48 h after
      incubation and was detected in the upper portion of the embryo's gut. After 72 h,
      MuLL was observed in the serosal cuticle and digestive tract. In conclusion, MuLL
      can function as an ovicidal agent against A. aegypti through damage to the
      surface and internal structures of the eggs.

TI  - A barcoding pipeline for mosquito surveillance in Nepal, a biodiverse
      dengue-endemic country.
PG  - 145
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05255-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vector-borne diseases are on the rise on a global scale, which is
      anticipated to further accelerate because of anthropogenic climate change.
      Resource-limited regions are especially hard hit by this increment with the
      currently implemented surveillance programs being inadequate for the observed
      expansion of potential vector species. Cost-effective methods that can be easily 
      implemented in resource-limited settings, e.g. under field conditions, are thus
      urgently needed to function as an early warning system for vector-borne disease
      epidemics. Our aim was to enhance entomological capacity in Nepal, a country with
      endemicity of numerous vector-borne diseases and with frequent outbreaks of
      dengue fever. METHODS: We used a field barcoding pipeline based on DNA nanopore
      sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and verified its use for different
      mosquito life stages and storage methods. We furthermore hosted an online
      workshop to facilitate knowledge transfer to Nepalese scientific experts from
      different disciplines. RESULTS: The use of the barcoding pipeline could be
      verified for adult mosquitos and eggs, as well as for homogenized samples, dried 
      specimens, samples that were stored in ethanol and frozen tissue. The transfer of
      knowledge was successful, as reflected by feedback from the participants and
      their wish to implement the method. CONCLUSIONS: Cost effective strategies are
      urgently needed to assess the likelihood of disease outbreaks. We were able to
      show that field sequencing provides a solution that is cost-effective,
      undemanding in its implementation and easy to learn. The knowledge transfer to
      Nepalese scientific experts from different disciplines provides an opportunity
      for sustainable implementation of low-cost portable sequencing solutions in
      Nepal.

AB  - One-third of the world's population is at risk of Dengue infection. Envelope
      domain 3 (EDIII) and nonstructural protein1 (NS1) proteins as the potent
      antigenicity regions for humoral immunity in addition to the bc loop region as a 
      completely conserved region have been used for designing protective vaccines. We 
      aimed to design vaccine candidates according to the bc loop, EDIII, and NS1
      regions of Dengue serotype2 to be used as vaccine candidates for all serotypes of
      Dengue virus especially serotype 2. Firstly the bc loop region with EDII
      fragments at both ends as well as EDIII and NS1 regions were used which were
      linked with the GGGGS linker to the bc loop region. In two other strategies, the 
      bc loop with EDII and NS1 fragments at both ends was used to increase its
      structural stability. Tertiary structure prediction and validation of vaccine
      constructs indicated that all vaccine constructs were modeled with high quality
      and stable structure during molecular dynamics simulation. B cell epitope mapping
      by Bepipred and ElliPro methods confirmed the existence of high potent epitopes
      in the bc loop, EDIII, and NS1 regions in both linear and conformational B cell
      epitopes. Furthermore, molecular docking for the bc loop region demonstrated that
      all designed vaccines have a higher affinity to interact with 1C19 monoclonal
      antibody than only the bc loop region or bc loop epitope in the protein EII. Our 
      data of in silico studies indicated that the designed vaccines could effectively 
      induce humoral immunity against four dengue serotypes.

LID - 10.3390/v14040792 [doi]
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a pathogenic, enveloped,
      positive-stranded RNA virus in the family Flaviviridae. Structural studies of
      flavivirus virions have primarily focused on mosquito-borne species, with only
      one cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a tick-borne species
      published. Here, we present a 3.3 A cryo-EM structure of the TBEV virion of the
      Kuutsalo-14 isolate, confirming the overall organisation of the virus. We observe
      conformational switching of the peripheral and transmembrane helices of M
      protein, which can explain the quasi-equivalent packing of the viral proteins and
      highlights their importance in stabilising membrane protein arrangement in the
      virion. The residues responsible for M protein interactions are highly conserved 
      in TBEV but not in the structurally studied Hypr strain, nor in mosquito-borne
      flaviviruses. These interactions may compensate for the lower number of hydrogen 
      bonds between E proteins in TBEV compared to the mosquito-borne flaviviruses. The
      structure reveals two lipids bound in the E protein which are important for virus
      assembly. The lipid pockets are comparable to those recently described in
      mosquito-borne Zika, Spondweni, Dengue, and Usutu viruses. Our results thus
      advance the understanding of tick-borne flavivirus architecture and
      virion-stabilising interactions.

TI  - Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of Acute Dengue Virus Infections
      Detected through Acute Febrile Illness Surveillance, Belize 2020.
LID - 768 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14040768 [doi]
AB  - The Acute Febrile Illness (AFI) Surveillance Network in Belize is a country-wide 
      active surveillance program aimed at diagnosing vector-borne, respiratory, and
      enteric pathogens among patients presenting to 11 participating hospitals and
      clinics with new onset fever. This study describes the epidemiology of dengue
      virus (DENV) infections in Belize diagnosed through AFI surveillance in 2020. Of 
      the 894 patients enrolled and PCR-tested for DENV in this period, 44
      DENV-positive cases (5%) were identified. All four DENV serotypes were detected, 
      with two cases testing positive for DENV serotype 4, which is the first report of
      this serotype in Belize since 2004. The majority of DENV cases (66%) were
      diagnosed in the Belize District, which contains the largest urban center in the 
      country (Belize City). Positive cases were detected between January 2020 and
      September 2020, with the majority (89%) diagnosed during the dry season between
      January and April, unlike years prior when cases were more often diagnosed during
      the wet season. Clinical signs and symptoms varied slightly between DENV
      serotypes. Active surveillance of DENV among AFI cases provides insight into the 
      epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of DENV in Belize. This information is
      important for informing public health interventions to mitigate DENV
      transmission.

TI  - Global Evolutionary History and Dynamics of Dengue Viruses Inferred from Whole
      Genome Sequences.
LID - 703 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14040703 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is an arboviral disease caused by dengue virus (DENV), leading to
      approximately 25,000 deaths/year and with over 40% of the world's population at
      risk. Increased international travel and trade, poorly regulated urban expansion,
      and warming global temperatures have expanded the geographic range and incidence 
      of the virus in recent decades. This study used phylogenetic and selection
      pressure analyses to investigate trends in DENV evolution, using whole genome
      coding sequences from publicly available databases alongside newly sequenced
      isolates collected between 1963-1997 from Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Results
      revealed very similar phylogenetic relationships when using the envelope gene and
      the whole genome coding sequences. Although DENV evolution is predominantly
      driven by negative selection, a number of amino acid sites undergoing positive
      selection were found across the genome, with the majority located in the envelope
      and NS5 genes. Some genotypes appear to be diversifying faster than others within
      each serotype. The results from this research improve our understanding of DENV
      evolution, with implications for disease control efforts such as Wolbachia-based 
      biocontrol and vaccine design.

TI  - Optimizing and Quantifying Gold Nanospheres Based on LSPR Label-Free Biosensor
      for Dengue Diagnosis.
LID - 1592 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14081592 [doi]
AB  - The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) due to light-particle interaction 
      and its dependence on the surrounding medium have been widely manipulated for
      sensing applications. The sensing efficiency is governed by the refractive
      index-based sensitivity (etaRIS) and the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the
      LSPR spectra. Thereby, a sensor with high precision must possess both requisites:
      an effective etaRIS and a narrow FWHM of plasmon spectrum. Moreover, complex
      nanostructures are used for molecular sensing applications due to their good
      etaRIS values but without considering the wide-band nature of the LSPR spectrum, 
      which decreases the detection limit of the plasmonic sensor. In this article, a
      novel, facile and label-free solution-based LSPR immunosensor was elaborated
      based upon LSPR features such as extinction spectrum and localized field
      enhancement. We used a 3D full-wave field analysis to evaluate the optical
      properties and to optimize the appropriate size of spherical-shaped gold
      nanoparticles (Au NPs). We found a change in Au NPs' radius from 5 nm to 50 nm,
      and an increase in spectral resonance peak depicted as a red-shift from 520 nm to
      552 nm. Using this fact, important parameters that can be attributed to the LSPR 
      sensor performance, namely the molecular sensitivity, FWHM, etaRIS, and figure of
      merit (FoM), were evaluated. Moreover, computational simulations were used to
      assess the optimized size (radius = 30 nm) of Au NPs with high FoM (2.3) and
      sharp FWHM (44 nm). On the evaluation of the platform as a label-free molecular
      sensor, Campbell's model was performed, indicating an effective peak shift in the
      adsorption of the dielectric layer around the Au NP surface. For practical
      realization, we present an LSPR sensor platform for the identification of dengue 
      NS1 antigens. The results present the system's ability to identify dengue NS1
      antigen concentrations with the limit of quantification measured to be 0.07
      mug/mL (1.50 nM), evidence that the optimization approach used for the
      solution-based LSPR sensor provides a new paradigm for engineering immunosensor
      platforms.

TI  - Carica papaya Leaf Juice for Dengue: A Scoping Review.
LID - 1584 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14081584 [doi]
AB  - The potential therapeutic effect of Carica papaya leaf juice has attracted wide
      interest from the public and scientists in relieving dengue related
      manifestations. Currently, there is a lack of evaluated evidence on its juice
      form. Therefore, this scoping review aims to critically appraise the available
      scientific evidence related to the efficacy of C. papaya leaf juice in dengue. A 
      systematic search was performed using predetermined keywords on two electronic
      databases (PubMed and Google Scholar). Searched results were identified, screened
      and appraised to establish the association between C. papaya and alleviating
      dengue associated conditions. A total of 28 articles (ethnobotanical information:
      three, in vitro studies: three, ex vivo studies: one, in vivo study: 13, clinical
      studies: 10) were included for descriptive analysis, which covered study
      characteristics, juice preparation/formulations, study outcomes, and toxicity
      findings. Other than larvicidal activity, this review also reveals two medicinal 
      potentials of C. papaya leaf juice on dengue infection, namely
      anti-thrombocytopenic and immunomodulatory effects. C. papaya leaf juice has the 
      potential to be a new drug candidate against dengue disease safely and
      effectively.

TI  - Charged Residue Implantation Improves the Affinity of a Cross-Reactive Dengue
      Virus Antibody.
LID - 4197 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23084197 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) has four serotypes that complicate vaccine development.
      Envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of DENV is a promising target for therapeutic
      antibody development. One EDIII-specific antibody, dubbed 1A1D-2, cross-reacts
      with DENV 1, 2, and 3 but not 4. To improve the affinity of 1A1D-2, in this
      study, we analyzed the previously solved structure of 1A1D-2-DENV2 EDIII complex.
      Mutations were designed, including A54E and Y105R in the heavy chain, with
      charges complementary to the epitope. Molecular dynamics simulation was then used
      to validate the formation of predicted salt bridges. Interestingly, a surface
      plasmon resonance experiment showed that both mutations increased affinities of
      1A1D-2 toward EDIII of DENV1, 2, and 3 regardless of their sequence variation.
      Results also revealed that A54E improved affinities through both a faster
      association and slower dissociation, whereas Y105R improved affinities through a 
      slower dissociation. Further simulation suggested that the same mutants
      interacted with different residues in different serotypes. Remarkably,
      combination of the two mutations additively improved 1A1D-2 affinity by 8, 36,
      and 13-fold toward DENV1, 2, and 3, respectively. In summary, this study
      demonstrated the utility of tweaking antibody-antigen charge complementarity for 
      affinity maturation and emphasized the complexity of improving antibody affinity 
      toward multiple antigens.

TI  - Targeting Zika Virus with New Brain- and Placenta-Crossing Peptide-Porphyrin
      Conjugates.
LID - 738 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14040738 [doi]
AB  - Viral disease outbreaks affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide and
      remain a serious threat to global health. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and
      other recent geographically- confined viral outbreaks (severe acute respiratory
      syndrome (SARS), Ebola, dengue, zika and ever-recurring seasonal influenza), also
      with devastating tolls at sanitary and socio-economic levels, are sobering
      reminders in this respect. Among the respective pathogenic agents, Zika virus
      (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes mosquito vectors and causing the eponymous fever, is
      particularly insidious in that infection during pregnancy results in
      complications such as foetal loss, preterm birth or irreversible brain
      abnormalities, including microcephaly. So far, there is no effective remedy for
      ZIKV infection, mainly due to the limited ability of antiviral drugs to cross
      blood-placental and/or blood-brain barriers (BPB and BBB, respectively). Despite 
      its restricted permeability, the BBB is penetrable by a variety of molecules,
      mainly peptide-based, and named BBB peptide shuttles (BBBpS), able to ferry
      various payloads (e.g., drugs, antibodies, etc.) into the brain. Recently, we
      have described peptide-porphyrin conjugates (PPCs) as successful BBBpS-associated
      drug leads for HIV, an enveloped virus in which group ZIKV also belongs. Herein, 
      we report on several brain-directed, low-toxicity PPCs capable of targeting ZIKV.
      One of the conjugates, PP-P1, crossing both BPB and BBB, has shown to be
      effective against ZIKV (IC50 1.08 microM) and has high serum stability (t1/2 ca. 
      22 h) without altering cell viability at all tested concentrations.
      Peptide-porphyrin conjugation stands out as a promising strategy to fill the ZIKV
      treatment gap.

TI  - Transcriptomics of Acute DENV-Specific CD8+ T Cells Does Not Support Qualitative 
      Differences as Drivers of Disease Severity.
LID - 612 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10040612 [doi]
AB  - While several lines of evidence suggest a protective role of T cells against
      disease associated with Dengue virus (DENV) infection, their potential
      contribution to immunopathology in the acute phase of DENV infection remains
      controversial, and it has been hypothesized that the more severe form of the
      disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF) is associated with altered T cell
      responses. To address this question, we determined the transcriptomic profiles of
      DENV-specific CD8+ T cells in a cohort of 40 hospitalized dengue patients with
      either a milder form of the disease (dengue fever, DF) or a more severe disease
      form (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF). We found multiple transcriptomic
      signatures, one associated with DENV-specific interferon-gamma responding cells
      and two other gene signatures, one specifically associated with the acute phase
      and the other with the early convalescent phase. Additionally, we found no
      differences in quantity and quality of DENV-specific CD8+ T cells based on
      disease severity. Taken together with previous findings that did not detect
      altered DENV-specific CD4 T cell responses, the current analysis argues against
      alteration in DENV-specific T cell responses as being a correlate of
      immunopathology.

      Retrospective Study in Indonesian.
LID - 950 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12040950 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a viral infection caused by the dengue virus (DENV). Dengue infection
      is a self-limited acute febrile illness caused by four serotypes of DENV
      (DENV-1~4). Early recognition of high-risk patients would be helpful to reduce
      mortality rates and prevent severe dengue. Our study aimed to identify factors
      related to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) based on admission-day data, and
      further to understand the distribution of biochemical laboratory data in dengue
      patients. This retrospective study was conducted in hospitals in Yogyakarta city,
      Indonesia, and involved febrile patients who were admitted to the hospital with a
      diagnosis of dengue during 2018 and 2020. Logistic regression models were used to
      identify variables related to DHF. In this study, 1087 patients were included as 
      suspected dengue patients, among them 468 had dengue fever (DF) and 619 had DHF. 
      Over half of the DHF patients were males (55.9%) with an average age of 17.9
      years, and with a secondary infection (71.3%). By a multivariate analysis,
      on-admission laboratory data of thrombocytopenia and hemoglobin showed
      significant association with DHF. Furthermore, DHF patients had significantly
      prolonged hospitalizations compared to DF patients. In conclusion, on-admission
      platelet counts and hemoglobin laboratory data are useful as predictors of DHF
      especially for suspected dengue patients with the limitations of diagnostic
      tests.

TI  - The cargo adapter protein CLINT1 is phosphorylated by the Numb-associated kinase 
      BIKE and mediates dengue virus infection.

AB  - The signaling pathways and cellular functions regulated by the four
      Numb-associated kinases are largely unknown. We reported that AAK1 and GAK
      control intracellular trafficking of RNA viruses and revealed a requirement for
      BIKE in early and late stages of dengue virus (DENV) infection. However, the
      downstream targets phosphorylated by BIKE have not yet been identified. Here, to 
      identify BIKE substrates, we conducted a barcode fusion genetics-yeast two-hybrid
      screen and retrieved publicly available data generated via affinity-purification 
      mass spectrometry. We subsequently validated 19 of 47 putative BIKE interactors
      using mammalian cell-based protein-protein interaction assays. We found that
      CLINT1, a cargo-specific adapter implicated in bidirectional Golgi-to-endosome
      trafficking, emerged as a predominant hit in both screens. Our experiments
      indicated that BIKE catalyzes phosphorylation of a threonine 294 CLINT1 residue
      both in vitro and in cell culture. Our findings revealed that CLINT1
      phosphorylation mediates its binding to the DENV nonstructural 3 protein and
      subsequently promotes DENV assembly and egress. Additionally, using live-cell
      imaging we revealed that CLINT1 cotraffics with DENV particles and is involved in
      mediating BIKE's role in DENV infection. Finally, our data suggest that
      additional cellular BIKE interactors implicated in the host immune and stress
      responses and the ubiquitin proteasome system might also be candidate
      phosphorylation substrates of BIKE. In conclusion, these findings reveal cellular
      substrates and pathways regulated by the understudied Numb-associated kinase
      enzyme BIKE, a mechanism for CLINT1 regulation, and control of DENV infection via
      BIKE signaling, with potential implications for cell biology, virology, and
      host-targeted antiviral design.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), an arthropod-borne flavivirus, has developed rapidly in the 
      past few decades and becoming the most widespread arbovirus in the world. The
      vital role of NS2B-NS3 in virus replication and maturation of viral proteins
      makes it the most promising target for anti-DENV drug discovery. In the current
      work, a potent NS2B-NS3 covalent inhibitor 23 (IC50 = 6.0 nM, k inac/K i = 1581
      M(-1) s(-1)) was discovered through the chemical modification of a published
      covalent inhibitor 1 (IC50 = 500 nM, k inac/K i = 156.1 M(-1) s(-1)), followed by
      in vitro assay. Further comprehensive structure-activity relationship analysis
      through covalent docking and molecular dynamics simulation provides informative
      understanding of the binding modes of covalent inhibitors targeting NS2B-NS3.

TI  - Data-driven computational intelligence applied to dengue outbreak forecasting: a 
      case study at the scale of the city of Natal, RN-Brazil.

AB  - Dengue is recognized as a health problem that causes significant socioeconomic
      impacts throughout the world, affecting millions of people each year. A commonly 
      used method for monitoring the dengue vector is to count the eggs that Aedes
      aegypti mosquitoes have laid in spatially distributed ovitraps. Given this
      approach, the present study uses a database collected from 397 ovitraps allocated
      across the city of Natal, RN-Brazil. The Egg Density Index for each neighborhood 
      was computed weekly, over four complete years (from 2016 to 2019), and
      simultaneously analyzed with the dengue case incidence. Our results illustrate
      that the incidence of dengue is related to the socioeconomic level of the
      neighborhoods in the city of Natal. A deep learning algorithm was used to predict
      future dengue case incidence, either based on the previous weeks of dengue
      incidence or the number of eggs present in the ovitraps. The analysis reveals
      that ovitrap data allows earlier prediction (four to six weeks) compared to
      dengue incidence itself (one week). Therefore, the results validate that the
      quantification of Aedes aegypti eggs can be valuable for the early planning of
      public health interventions.

TI  - Prohemocytes are the main cells infected by dengue virus in Aedes aegypti and
      Aedes albopictus.
PG  - 137
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05276-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The primary disease vectors for dengue virus (DENV) transmission
      between humans are the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, with Ae.
      aegypti population size strongly correlated with DENV outbreaks. When a mosquito 
      is infected with DENV, the virus migrates from the midgut to the salivary glands 
      to complete the transmission cycle. How the virus crosses the hemocoel, resulting
      in systemic infection, is still unclear however. During viral infection and
      migration, the innate immune system is activated in defense. As part of
      cellular-mediated immunity, hemocytes are known to defend against bacteria and
      Plasmodium infection and may also participate in defending against DENV
      infection. Hemocytes are categorized into three cell types: prohemocytes,
      granulocytes, and oenocytoids. Here, we investigated which hemocytes can be
      infected by DENV and compare hemocyte infection between Ae. aegypti and Ae.
      albopictus. METHODS: Hemocytes were collected from Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus
      mosquitoes that were intrathoracically infected with DENV2-GFP. The collected
      hemocytes were then identified via Giemsa staining and examined microscopically
      for morphological differences and viral infection. RESULTS: All three types of
      hemocytes were infected by DENV, though the predominantly infected cell type was 
      prohemocytes. In Ae. aegypti, the highest and lowest infection rates at 7 days
      post infection occurred in prohemocytes and granulocytes, respectively.
      Prohemocytes were also the primary infection target of DENV in Ae. albopictus,
      with similar infection rates across the other two hemocyte groups. The ratios of 
      hemocyte composition did not differ significantly between non-infected and
      infected mosquitoes for either species. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we showed
      that prohemocytes were the major type of hemocyte infected by DENV in both Ae.
      aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The infection rate of prohemocytes in Ae. albopictus 
      was lower than that in Ae. aegypti, which may explain why systemic DENV infection
      in Ae. albopictus is less efficient than in Ae. aegypti and why Ae. albopictus is
      less correlated to dengue fever outbreaks. Future work in understanding the
      mechanisms behind these phenomena may help reduce arbovirus infection prevalence.

TI  - Cytotoxicity and Antiviral Properties of Alkaloids Isolated from Pancratium
      maritimum.

AB  - Ten Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (AAs) were isolated for the first time from
      Pancratium maritimum collected in Calabria region, Italy. They belong to
      different subgroups of this family and were identified as lycorine, which is the 
      main alkaloid, 9-O-demethyllycorine, haemanthidine, haemanthamine,
      11-hydroxyvittatine, homolycorine, pancracine, obliquine, tazettine and
      vittatine. Haemanthidine was isolated as a scalar mixture of two 6-epimers, as
      already known also for other 6-hydroxycrinine alkaloids, but for the first time
      they were separated as 6,11-O,O'-di-p-bromobenzoyl esters. The evaluation of the 
      cytotoxic and antiviral potentials of all isolated compounds was undertaken.
      Lycorine and haemanthidine showed cytotoxic activity on Hacat cells and A431 and 
      AGS cancer cells while, pancracine exhibited selective cytotoxicity against A431 
      cells. We uncovered that in addition to lycorine and haemanthidine, haemanthamine
      and pancracine also possess antiretroviral abilities, inhibiting pseudotyped
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 with EC50 of 25.3 microM and 18.5 microM
      respectively. Strikingly, all the AAs isolated from P. maritimum were able to
      impede dengue virus (DENV) replication (EC50 ranged from 0.34-73.59 microM) at
      low to non-cytotoxic concentrations (CC50 ranged from 6.25 microM to &gt;100
      microM). Haemanthamine (EC50 = 337 nM), pancracine (EC50 = 357 nM) and
      haemanthidine (EC50 = 476 nM) were the most potent anti-DENV inhibitors. Thus,
      this study uncovered new antiviral properties of P. maritimum isolated alkaloids,
      a significant finding that could lead to the development of new therapeutic
      strategies to fight viral infectious diseases.
