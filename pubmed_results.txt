TI  - Gadolinium and Polythiophene Functionalized Polyurea Polymer Dots as
      Fluoro-Magnetic Nanoprobes.

AB  - A rapid and one-pot synthesis of poly 3-thiopheneacetic acid (PTAA)
      functionalized polyurea polymer dots (Pdots) using polyethyleneimine and
      isophorone diisocyanate is reported. The one-pot mini-emulsion polymerization
      technique yielded Pdots with an average diameter of ~20 nm. The size, shape, and 
      concentration of the surface functional groups could be controlled by altering
      the synthesis parameters such as ultrasonication time, concentration of the
      surfactant, and crosslinking agent, and the types of isocyanates utilized for the
      synthesis. Colloidal properties of Pdots were characterized using dynamic light
      scattering and zeta potential measurements. The spherical geometry of Pdots was
      confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The Pdots were post-functionalized by 
      1,4,7,10 tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid for chelating gadolinium
      nanoparticles (Gd(3+)) that provide magnetic properties to the Pdots. Thus, the
      synthesized Pdots possess fluorescent and magnetic properties, imparted by PTAA
      and Gd(3+), respectively. Fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy revealed that 
      the synthesized dual-functional Gd(3+)-Pdots exhibited detectable fluorescent
      signals even at lower concentrations. Magnetic levitation experiments indicated
      that the Gd(3+)-Pdots could be easily manipulated via an external magnetic field.
      These findings illustrate that the dua- functional Gd(3+)-Pdots could be
      potentially utilized as fluorescent reporters that can be magnetically
      manipulated for bioimaging applications.

      scoliosis management.

LID - 10.4102/sajp.v77i2.1568 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In pattern-specific scoliosis exercises and bracing, the corrective
      treatment plan differs according to different curve patterns. There are a limited
      number of studies investigating the reliability of the commonly used
      classifications systems. OBJECTIVE: To test the reliability of the augmented
      Lehnert-Schroth (ALS) classification and the Rigo classification. METHODS: X-rays
      and posterior photographs of 45 patients with scoliosis were sent by the first
      author to three clinicians twice at 1-week intervals. The clinicians classified
      images according to the ALS and Rigo classifications, and the data were analysed 
      using SPSS V-16. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard error
      measurement (SEM) were calculated to evaluate the inter- and intra-observer
      reliability. RESULTS: The inter-observer ICC values were 0.552 (ALS), 0.452
      (Rigo) for X-ray images and 0.494 (ALS), 0.518 (Rigo) for the photographs. The
      average intra-observer ICC value was 0.720 (ALS), 0.581 (Rigo) for the X-ray
      images and 0.726 (ALS) and 0.467 (Rigo) for the photographs. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results of our study indicate moderate inter-observer reliability for X-ray
      images using the ALS classification and clinical photographs using the Rigo
      classification. Intra-observer reliability was moderate to good for X-ray images 
      and clinical photographs using the ALS classification and poor to moderate for
      X-ray and clinical photographs using the Rigo classification. CLINICAL
      IMPLICATIONS: Pattern classifications assist in creating a plan and indication of
      correction in specific scoliosis physiotherapy and pattern-specific brace
      applications and surgical treatment. More sub-types are needed to address the
      individual patterns of curvature. The optimisation of curve classification will
      likely reduce failures in diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Ticks and Tick-Borne Pathogens Associated with Dromedary Camels (Camelus
      dromedarius) in Northern Kenya.
LID - 1414 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9071414 [doi]
AB  - Ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) are major constraints to camel health and
      production, yet epidemiological data on their diversity and impact on dromedary
      camels remain limited. We surveyed the diversity of ticks and TBPs associated
      with camels and co-grazing sheep at 12 sites in Marsabit County, northern Kenya. 
      We screened blood and ticks (858 pools) from 296 camels and 77 sheep for
      bacterial and protozoan TBPs by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing
      of PCR products. Hyalomma (75.7%), Amblyomma (17.6%) and Rhipicephalus (6.7%)
      spp. ticks were morphologically identified and confirmed by molecular analyses.
      We detected TBP DNA in 80.1% of blood samples from 296 healthy camels.
      "Candidatus Anaplasma camelii", "Candidatus Ehrlichia regneryi" and Coxiella
      burnetii were detected in both camels and associated ticks, and Ehrlichia
      chaffeensis, Rickettsia africae, Rickettsia aeschlimannii and Coxiella
      endosymbionts were detected in camel ticks. We also detected Ehrlichia
      ruminantium, which is responsible for heartwater disease in ruminants, in
      Amblyomma ticks infesting camels and sheep and in sheep blood, indicating its
      endemicity in Marsabit. Our findings also suggest that camels and/or the ticks
      infesting them are disease reservoirs of zoonotic Q fever (C. burnetii),
      ehrlichiosis (E. chaffeensis) and rickettsiosis (R. africae), which pose public
      health threats to pastoralist communities.

      bird species.
PG  - e0249633
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0249633 [doi]
AB  - Climate change is having profound effects on the distributions of species
      globally. Trait-based assessments predict that specialist and range-restricted
      species are among those most likely to be at risk of extinction from such
      changes. Understanding individual species' responses to climate change is
      therefore critical for informing conservation planning. We use an established
      Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) protocol to describe the curious
      range-restriction of the globally threatened White-tailed Swallow (Hirundo
      megaensis) to a small area in southern Ethiopia. We find that, across a range of 
      modelling approaches, the distribution of this species is well described by two
      climatic variables, maximum temperature and dry season precipitation. These same 
      two variables have been previously found to limit the distribution of the
      unrelated but closely sympatric Ethiopian Bush-crow (Zavattariornis stresemanni).
      We project the future climatic suitability for both species under a range of
      climate scenarios and modelling approaches. Both species are at severe risk of
      extinction within the next half century, as the climate in 68-84% (for the
      swallow) and 90-100% (for the bush-crow) of their current ranges is predicted to 
      become unsuitable. Intensive conservation measures, such as assisted migration
      and captive-breeding, may be the only options available to safeguard these two
      species. Their projected disappearance in the wild offers an opportunity to test 
      the reliability of SDMs for predicting the fate of wild species. Monitoring
      future changes in the distribution and abundance of the bush-crow is particularly
      tractable because its nests are conspicuous and visible over large distances.

AB  - PURPOSE: Road traffic accidents remain as the most common cause of maxillofacial 
      injuries in developed countries. To the best of our knowledge, comparative
      analysis of fracture localizations and injury types of injured pedestrians and
      passengers is seldom performed. Thus, this study aimed to compare maxillofacial
      injuries between pedestrians and passengers injured in road traffic accidents in 
      terms of demographic characteristics of the patients, localization of fractures, 
      and treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population was composed of
      patients who underwent surgery for maxillofacial fractures resulting from road
      traffic accidents. They were divided into the pedestrian group and passenger
      group. Demographic data, fracture sites, and treatment methods were investigated 
      retrospectively. RESULTS: Most of the patients were 20 to 30 years of age.
      Isolated mandible fractures occurred in 55.71% of the pedestrian group and 43.78%
      of the passenger group. Panfacial fractures were observed in 5.71% (n = 8) of the
      patients in the pedestrian group compared with 14.28% (n = 21) in the passenger
      group. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the injury pattern and mechanism of in-vehicle
      accidents, fractures tend to be located in the middle and upper facial bones
      rather than in the mandible. Thus, careful management in triage is important, as 
      each group has specific injury patterns. Patients with panfacial fractures
      require meticulous management because they are at risk for high-energy injury and
      comorbidities.

TI  - Maternal infection and stillbirth: a review.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2020.1852206 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Maternal infections likely are an important cause of stillbirths,
      especially in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where the burden is highest. Due
      to the lack of routine testing for infection, which can be complex and often
      expensive, the prevalence of infection during pregnancy and the association of
      many infections with stillbirth are not well-documented, especially in
      low-resource countries.Methods: Following an extensive literature review of
      infection and stillbirth initially published in 2010, we conducted a review of
      literature in the last 10 years to identify infections associated with
      stillbirth, focused on those in low-resource settings.Results: During the last 10
      years, over 40 bacterial, viral and other pathogens have been associated with
      stillbirth. Newly emerging viral infections such as Denge as well as several
      well-established, but not yet eliminated infections such as rubella have been
      associated with stillbirth. Two of the maternal infections most strongly
      associated with stillbirth, each with about a 2-fold risk, are malaria and
      syphilis but others have been associated with risk in a range of studies. With a 
      lack of routine antenatal screening, many pathogens are identified as associated 
      with stillbirth only through case reports. Infection remains an important, yet
      understudied, cause of stillbirth.Conclusion: Research studies to determine
      definitive associations between various infections and stillbirth are important
      to better understand the role of infections and strategies to reduce
      infection-related stillbirth.Summary This review explores the association between
      infections and stillbirths focusing on low-income country studies published in
      the last 10 years. Much information about these relationships comes from case
      reports. Research resulting in a better understanding of the causes and
      strategies to reduce infection-related stillbirth is necessary.

TI  - Thyroid Surgery in a Resource-Limited Setting.
PG  - 464-471
LID - 10.1177/0194599816684097 [doi]
AB  - Objective The present study reviews a series of patients who underwent thyroid
      surgery in Eldoret, Kenya, to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting long-term
      (>1 year) outcomes research in a resource-limited setting, impact on the quality 
      of life of the recipient population, and inform future humanitarian
      collaborations. Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting Tertiary
      public referral hospital in Eldoret, Kenya. Subjects and Methods Twenty-one
      patients were enrolled during the study period. A retrospective chart review was 
      performed for all adult patients who underwent thyroid surgery during
      humanitarian trips (2010-2015). Patients were contacted by mobile telephone.
      Medical history and physical examination, including laryngoscopy, were performed,
      and the SF-36 was administered (a quality-of-life questionnaire). Laboratory
      measurements of thyroid function and neck ultrasound were obtained. Results The
      mean follow-up was 33.6 +/- 20.2 months after surgery: 37.5% of subtotal
      thyroidectomy patients and 15.4% of lobectomy patients were hypothyroid
      postoperatively according to serologic studies. There were no cases of goiter
      recurrence or malignancy. All patients reported postoperative symptomatic
      improvement and collectively showed positive pre- and postoperative score
      differences on the SF-36. Conclusion Although limited by a small sample size and 
      the retrospective nature, our study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term
      surgical and quality-of-life outcomes research in a resource-limited setting. The
      low complication rates suggest minimal adverse effects of performing surgery in
      this context. Despite a considerable rate of postoperative hypothyroidism, it is 
      in accordance with prior studies and emphasizes the need for individualized,
      longitudinal, and multidisciplinary care. Quality-of-life score improvements
      suggest benefit to the recipient population.

AB  - The residual neurovirulence of the previously obtained chimeric virus Tp21/DEN4, 
      containing the RNA region encoding the pre M and E structural enzymes, strain
      Tp21, virus Langat, and the remaining part of the genome from the Denge 4 virus, 
      was studied in experiments with monkeys Cercopithecus aethiops involving the
      intracerebral administration of the virus. The tick-borne encephalitis virus,
      strain Absettarov, was used as positive control. A comparative analysis of the
      experimental and published data showed the chimeric virus to be less virulent by 
      its degree of morphological affection in the CNS zones, its spread into the CNS
      and by a percentage share of animals with viremia versus the Tp21 parent strain
      and Elantsev strain of the Langat virus.
